       "'NOTE: Very bad experience with this iPhone xr phone. Back camera found defective and non functional. Amazon is very careless. I haven\\'t got any response on confirmation for replacing. I am just hanging with a damaged piece worth of more than 91000 rupees. Amazing phone with amazing camera coming from iPhone 7 plus great service from amazon So I got the iPhone XR just today. The product looks amazing. But unfortunately the Face ID is not working and thereís a glitch in the front cameraís portrait mode. Thatís fine, it may happen. But whatís not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple. Firstly, amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold. Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple! I\\'ve been an android user all my life until I decided to try iPhone XR for iOS. Loving the camera and battery life is an absolute joy to have. It\\'s been more than one month since I got this phone and I\\'m loving it. Face ID works flawlessly even in the dark and the dual sim function is working like a charm, I\\'m using Vodafone as my primary sim and Jio as e-sim and have faced no problem whatsoever. I was delivered a phone that did not work immediately after removing from the box. I was not able to return it as I need to first check with Apple. Apple service told me that the phone was lying without charge since 5 months and hence the battery failed. Now I have had to leave the phone with Apple for repairs and waiting for them to replace the battery. Please answer this: WHY SHOULD I RUN AROUND FOR THE SUB PAR QUALITY DEVICE WHEN I WAS SHIPPED A DEAD PHONE? Last time I ever purchase a phone online It has been a month since I started using my iPhone XR and the experience has been awesome. Excellent battery life, smooth operating system, and most of all, dual Sim functionality are the best features of this iPhone. Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and Iím very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife. Only issue bothering me is the time taken to charge the phone. You need to opt for overnight charging. Other than that, extremely happy with the purchase. The phone is hanging. Video quality is not very good. I\\'ll use this review to mostly say what I\\'m not a fan of in this particular iPhone model. Went with the iPhone XR after over a month of consideration.Amazon was offering some really good discounts and felt the time was right to upgrade having used the iPhone 6 for four seamless years.

Went with the iPhone XR after over a month of consideration.Amazon was offering some really good discounts and felt the time was right to upgrade having used the iPhone 6 for four seamless years. Best mobile  and my favourite Where nice XR Amazing futures and best camera so thanks for  Amazon Don\\'t buy Apple products from Amazon. I got a defective product which is not activating. During first charging the iPhone started heating like anything. Since there was a 10 days replacement policy, so I asked Amazon to replace it as the product is defective. But very poor customer service from Amazon. They didn\\'t change the iPhone rather told me to visit service centre. Now I am with a defective product which is not operating. Face recognition is slower some times. I have no complaints about it. I am die hard fan of XR. I was eagerly waiting for dual sim iPhone. Itís heavy but looks are so attractive that you will be ready to carry that little extra weight. I am using it since two months. Donít watch any reviews. Just buy it and enjoy. Yes itís expensive. Sometimes rather many times money is not worth than happiness. Great Phone, I am happy with the phone so far. There are lots of reviews on net for XR, I would give just quick points based on my experience of XR 128 GB. Donít buy this phone only waste of money it hangís many time. STEVE JOBS GONE i phone gone !!!!!! Single SIM is working fine but if you are using E-sim in this phone. Not good quality for dual sim. Many times Number showing switched off. It is not supporting any type of sim.. the network gets disconnected after sometime only i always was unhappy with the size of my previous iPhones (iPhone 7 and 5s), I badly needed an upgrade and but donít have the budget of 1lakh so I took my chances with XR and I am very happy with my purchase. This is a product which lets down the whole high end feel of an iPhone. Apple has packed in a very sophisticated software hardware system in a rather disappointing design and the phone is bulkier and heavier than any of its competition in the market. The premium feel of the product is completely let down and left to enjoy is a good software interface of ios and an excellent camera. Overall a cheap buy for an apple lover but for a first time user the phone is totally let down. Im facing some speaker related issues and had given my handset XR 64 Gb in service center they denied to repair the same stating that the handset is fake and not valid for any warrenty All in all an amazing product yet again from Apple. I know many people are confused wheather to go for an apple X or Xr. Well to be frank i suggest XR purely because of the fact that XR will have 1yr more support from Apple in respect to X.  Other than that the dual camera of X and single camera of XR have the same quality. As far as speed goes both are same. Xr is dual sim but you gotta understand you can insert just 1 sim. The 2nd sim is an eSim which needs to be activated by Telecom service providers. Theres not much difference in display as well. All in all XR rules I had taken the phone but the phones holds too many defects and issues. When we talk the mouth pice is not that precise to hold you voice creaky the voice is not audible if the phone is even partially away from your chin/mouth. there are two angles from which smartphones are generally looked. and i will be very honest in this review so that a genuine user can understand if he really wants apple! Smooth as butter, no lag and awesome display with superb camera..Just the perfect phone Using around a week now. Itís snappy fast. Power efficient. Gives a back up of a whole day on average use. It has a single but impressive rear camera. Selfie camera is excellent. Low light performance is average though. The phone is bulky, Heavy, weighing more than 190 grams. You surely need to use a protective case to protect Camera bump and glass on both sides. Display is crisp. This is by far the best smartphone i have ever owned. A Perfect Phone with a great camera, great performance, Great look, Great Battery life and a good Display. Worth the trade off. Perfect size NEVER BUY it from Amazon. VERY POOR PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER CARE.i bought it and received it on 3.10.2019 and noted a crack on right top corner of display which was visible when the plastic sticker was removed and complained to amazon customer cell on 4.10.2019. they assured a replacement. nothing happened. when i called them a number of times, they simply tranfer my calls to diiferent sections and then assurinng call back and then not calling back. Apple says it is the duty of amazon to take measures for replacement. Still left nowhere with my money gone on a damaged product. Extremely easy to use. Good specifications. Best iPhone Iíve used. Sold my one plus 6 and got this one. The screen is not an OLED so you miss out on deep blacks and saturation. But I noticed the colours are better than the older iPhones with LCD. It also has thick bezels which take some time to get used to. An OLED screen on this wouldíve been wonderful but apple being apple wont do that! Poor Front camera cannot take photo with light at background (photo attached) This is my first phone from Apple. I was in confusion in buying between pixel and iphone. Even though pixel is far superior than apple in all departments, I went for iphone due to craziness. The product is well packed and delivered. When I started using the phone, the screen looks average, battery is good and the hardware seems good. The camera disappoints me al lot. Never expect this from Apple. In particular, the front camera is worst, in indoor lightning conditions and can see dots in image like a VGA camera.  At a cost of 60k, I was more so curious about the camera. It disappoints me badly. Even my motorola camera works well. If you are crazzy for the brand, go for it. Else definitely, you can go for other models in the market. This Appario seem to be a fraud. My shipment has been smartly tampered and the have managed to overcome the security features. Even iPhone package back label have been tampered. Amazon Customer Care on phone or Twitter is of no help. I need to return this and get a replacement. Most Beautiful, Fast and Stylish iPhone, I\\'ve ever Had.. Like every time, Apple has again mesmerised me with itís great creation iPhone XR. The best part in this is when you unbox your brand new iPhone. It comes with an earpod, and a Fast charger. I understand that the price might be a bit high but trust me, itís worth it. The camera has the best feature within it. Everyone says that itís an LCD screen but youíll nit be able to differentiate just by looking at the screen. The phone performance  is more faster now. And last but not the least, I am really impressed with the battery back up time. It really lasts. Full charge at 10 am and then the whole day on Cellular Data, I have played PES2019, played some songs from YouTube Music, hovering on Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook and clicked some good photos. When i came back home at 11 oíclock, i still had 66% charge. Thatís what we needed in an iPhone. iPhone XR is excellent there is no doubt about this. This first time my iPhone experience. Its great experience. But I am very unhappy about the dual sim performance (May be solved the problem). Been a iPhone user always. Upgraded to iPhone XR from iPhone 6 and I have no regrets. Just love the ease that face recognition brings in... freedom that 128GB memory brings in... and of course peace of mind that Apple brand name brings in. the phone wont turn on A lot of criticism of iPhone XR has been about its inability to take portrait pics of ìonly human faces!î Though true, it can be very easily overcome by downloading a software app - ìHalide!î That and the near negligible difference in viewing experience, puts it on par with iPhone XS and even XS Max! Just go for itó the 256 GB storage version! Prices have fallen by rs 10000 in 3 days after I bought my phone. I feel terrible. Faulty product delivered and Amazon not giving replacement. Cheating with customer and just making money by scam and defective product delivery. Phone is not usable as display stop working randomly and screen freeze suddenly. I have provide problem video also to Amazon within 10 days of replacement but Amazon just making money and cheating with customer. †Iphone is good but probably I have received a defective piece from amazon as I am facing issues with software. Further never heard a iphone to be hanging issue but I am facing the same and attached a video regarding it. Within a month I have to visit customer care and still facing issues. Very worst experience donít buy it from amazon. Super fast performance, long battery hours, little heavier than iphone 7 plus. Overall good phone. Has many drawbacks. Apps developed for iPhone by Indian Companies arenít good at all. You canít even do a normal Tatkal booking as irctc app unavailable. No dual Whatsapp so one number is wasted. No dual Facebook as well. Maximum 5gb cloud backup storage limit. Apps get refreshed more frequently and better enhancements on android. No features to search apps easily. Wifi once disconnected loses auto join features. Maximum 100 call records thatís very very annoying. Difficult to set primary and secondary sims in sms. Some Whatsapp features missing. It is heavy weight if u use more ull feel it hard to hold on regular note! There have been multiple issues faced since started installing and restoring from icloud. Gets hanged/stuck, suddenly WiFi gets disconnected and doesn\\'t get connected till restart, deteriorated network speed on usage of the data..... First off, the battery life is INCREDIBLE! This is the first phone I have used where I can get two days of use on one charge! I would regularly charge the phone overnight one night, then go to bed at midnight with 55-60% left the next night, leave it unplugged, and finish the next day at midnight with around 2-5%. The size of the phone was just just about perfect for holding/scrolling with one hand, and I usually wear menís size medium gloves for reference. When compared with XS only visible difference would be screen, that too when kept side by side. Awesome IPhone.. I have upgraded from iPhone 6 and I can notice the significant different in display, touch and XR is certainly faster. Itís worth the upgrade..! Thank you Amazon for delivering it securely. Got this phone for offer price. Everything is great from packing to delivery. Display quality is very good. Dual sim option is very good, got esim from airtel Bought this phone for my wife. She\\'s absolutely happy with the phone. I want to replace this iphone because since i got this it worked well for w week then later on its speed is slowed down and even it hangs sometimes. Its been 3 months since i got this n i m already irritated with this device. My lighting usb has already stopped working . Great phone for better photos and low light battery usage is much better than X So overall itís a pretty nice phone, I honestly donít find much difference in features from my old iPhone 6. Apart from face recognition. Good phone Iíve been using Android for close to a decade and now decided to check out iOS. Thanks to Amazon Prime Sale, got iPhone XR for a discounted price(Still expensive), Coming to the iPhone itself, after using phone for 3 days, below are the points I came across. Using this phone since 2 months. Here is my review. Hope you will find it useful. I was skeptical looking at some XR reviews and also purchasing an iPhone off Amazon (previously always bought through Apple Stores). However, so far happy with what I have. The delivery was fast (on Prime, next day); all original packing (phone box) and phone is working fine. Touchwood - no issues. The Deal was good with the 10% additional HDFC discount. Go for 128 GB (or even higher) - the few extra thousand are worth it when you run out of space. I got a defective iPhone XR. The screen is defective. Thereís a blue shade on all the four sides of the screen. The phoneís working completely fine though.  So whoever purchased the phone while unboxing please check your device thoroughly. It was my mistake that i thought that maybe itís something related to software which will be fixed after software update but it didnít. And in that belief i skipped my 10 days return policy as well. I still donít blaim amazon because i have purchased my Airpods from them as well. But still appario should not sell defective products to customers. Now i have to go through a hassle of getting the screen replaced from service centre and for that service centre will keep my phone for at least 7-10 days. Itís disappointing that i have to go through all this for a brand new phone. The reason why i didnít upload a pic is bcuz it will not be visible in a pic taken from another phone. ALL good †I chose iPhone XR over x. The reasons are, it is 6.1-inch display and supports dual sim. the Battery Durability longs last. I got the Brand New peace (made in 2019, September) without any defect. During the great India sale, I saw this model on offer and my sister was dying to get a new phone since her old phone was barely keeping up. I finally made up my mind,, arranged the funds and got it for my sister. Phone looks beautiful. I bought it just one month before thru Amazon, when I put my sim it\\'s speaker has not been working , it is difficult to listen voice sometimes it becomes disconnected. Although my android phone is working good at the same place. I don\\'t know whom should I contact about my complaint. After transition from Android to iOS, I felt Android is more user friendly compared to iOS. I am not able to activate iphone after several attempts. Today only i purchased. Hello friends!! This is my honest review after using it for almost 2 months. I was using android since last seven years but then I decided to go for iPhone. Here are the pros and cons according to me which I have felt after using it for almost 2 months So upgrading from 6S+ to XR. First reactions: Everything look good but I never expect. Upgraded from 5s to xr after 3 years of 5s use. Purchased it at ?37999 after low battery issues with 5s. Why I choose xr rather than iPhone 8 ,7 or even 6s even when I bought 5s after 3 years of its initial launch is Before I start this review Iíll let you know, I love the Apple brand and Iíve never used a 1080p OLED phone in my life (This screen seems perfectly normal to me). That being said Iíll dive into the review. I got this phone on the Prime day sale and Iíve been using it for almost a month now and here are my thoughts about this phone. Got this product in the amazon flash sale and got a decent discount. Have been using the device for a few days and can certainly say that this iPhone has the best battery life till date. Phone lasted for almost 30 hours with heavy usage. The face recognition has certainly been improved from iPhone X. The only thing I dislike about the phone is the Screen Quality. You wonít find any major difference in the screen quality unless and until you stream Netflix or watch YouTube. Overall I feel this is one of the best iPhones apple has launched. You will always feel cheated after buying an iPhone. It will get cheaper by every next 2-3 months. I have been using this phone for a while now. When I decided to buy this phone I checked on negative reviews first and after buying thought of using it first and then give a feedback. This is the perfect Phone with all advanced features for a normal user, which is worth for the price. Moving unto the flaws seen on the feedbacks, most of them complaining about the display being low resolution and LCD. In my opinion you wonít spot any difference with other iPhone displays. Another thing Iíve seen than lot of people complaining about the single camera, however, the picture quality you get will amuse you. Bought this during Prime sale. I love to use Apple products because of its simplicity. I was using iPhone 6 and thought of updating. While the XS and XS Max are more than a Lakh in India, iPhone XR is bang for the buck. The prime day deal was more sweet and surprise to me. The operation and touch responses are silky smooth. Dual Sim with the eSIM works like a charm. Rear camera is awesome with face detection AI Bookeh in Portrait mode. Screen resolution is very good and crisp without any pixel issues. It lacks 3D Touch but Apple incorporated Taptic Engine which will be updated to replace 3D Touch functionality eventually (though some are present now, it is limited). Some APPs are not good in the notch area though but it is ok to manage. Overall a nice update. Received the product next day only but packaging was not good as it is a cellphone box they should cover it with some thing  Phone is working fine but some times apps automatically closes I am a bit confused if it is a genuine product or not  I would suggest people not to buy from amazon you should go to your nearest store and buy it I am a recent convert from Android. I have used Samsung and Xiaomi phones earlier. Here is my initial impression: Donít get swayed by some lame reviewers on YouTube. If u r holding out for an iPhone purchase then this is the real deal. The Xr is a jack of all trades although not excelling in any. The A12 Bionic is a beast,níuff said already, the stereo speakers sound sweet and battery life is great. I found the most bashed about lcd display very pragmatic for everyday use.The portrait shots taken with the camera look a stunner.With the reason price cut , this has turned out to be the VFM iPhone ever made Received product yesterday and product looks perfectly awesome. Excellent phone. I am using it since 3 months. No problem. Classy product. Bought during Diwali sale @39k. Excellent battery backup lasting more than a day. Mind that I am a heavy user. Excellent photos. SIRI works well. No issues faced. Must go for it over other Chinese product in this price segment. Iphone not working since I opened the box. Apple support of little help. Amazon not taking the return. Asking for a report from Apple. Now I have to chase Apple to get a report. Nightmare starts when you buy from Amazon. There are many pros about this phone which you must be already aware of . I would like to point out at cons Face ID and front camera portrait mode isn\\'t working just after 3 months of purchase. It must be a problem of true depth sensor. My city (Imphal) apple servicing centre doesn\\'t allow me to take for servicing and tells me to go to Guwahati (Assam) for this problem. May be a coincidence because this problem happened when I used amazon basics 10w fast wireless charger which I combine with xiaomi quick charge 3 I was using iphone 6 since last three years before switching to Iphone XR. The following are the things that impressed me the most. Camera superb I bought this iPhone XR from October Amazon Great Indian Festival at deep discount. At Rs 38000 after all discounts were applied was a WOW deal. THANK YOU Amazon. Nothing can beat iPhone. This is my fourth phone (iPhone SE, iPhone 6, iPhone 8 and now this) purchased from Amazon. All are excellent phones. Except for screen resolution, iPhone XR is nothing less than XS or XS Max. In fact, the battery life is twice as that of iPhone 8. Face recognition is excellent even in dark while android phones lack this technology. White is a beautiful color. Delivery was before scheduled deadline and in good external packing. I was bit worried about the authenticity of buying iphone online with unknown seller and by paying huge amount ,I took the  Risk but i would say amazon and seller  has done a wonderful job ,i checked the product  in apple website and its a genuine product with 1 year warranty..iphone is iphone with best processor,camera ,good battery life ,good for gaming and with  regular  updates from apple .. IOS: Itís a very awesome mobile. Overall itís really good. Hats off to apple that they provide these kinda of awesome products. The iPhone XR goes blank the next day!!! Was sceptical at first. But after I received the phone itís good and in mint condition. I am upgrading from iPhone 7 and itís worth it. My iPhone 7 was 3 years old, and was lagging before I took the leap. Camera is more like the android phone with some Chinese lens I think. Battery life is so soothing! Face recognition is like butter. (Donít know what will happen in the future) best part upgrading is the screen  size. Totally worth it. Videos are a bit dull but for the cost itís worth it!! Thank you amazon for not sending a duplicate phone. Well after buying this iPhone i am never switching back to android. In two months the phone got destroyed its screen is filled with water its ip certification is nil bloody ios..... Battery quality is worst I have honor 8c and it gives 2 days backup and this phone last only 12 hours with medium usage no fast charger takes tradatitional 3 hours for full charging if u want to waste your money then go for it if u r not brand conscious buy other brands phone with much more better  configurations that too almost half of its price Their is No earpods no lightning cable or connector in that box and will call after few minutes it blanks the call,not even a bip. Kindly give me some suggestions to rectify that Got it for 38k during prime early access, one of the best purchase for value of money is considered. iOS 13 future releases might make it even more snappier and battery consumption efficiency. Played WOW Blitz in 60FPS and found no issues. Will post the PUBG and Fortnite review in few days. Battery back up is about 6hrs screen on time for apps usage scenario. I ordered this phone on Diwali offer. The phone which I got first had display issue , so I got replacement for that.my previous phone was iPhone 6 Plus.  After one week of using this phone, these are my honest review.  Firstly the phone has excellent battery life . For average use, the battery lasts more than a day easily. Although charging takes time ie about 2 to 3 hours from 10% to 100%. As I am used to iPhone home button, Iím feeling a bit uncomfortable with this phone as it has no home button. You have to swipe up every time from bottom to top to unlock the phone. It has no finger print sensor . So itís a bit difficult to unlock while ur in bed as u have to put ur face in front of the phone for FACE ID. Reach ability is an issue if u use one handed. Especially while using Facebook, when u have to swipe down from bottom line to make ur finger reach the top screen clicking options. Display of the screen is a bit below iPhone 6 Plus. So all in all the phone is just about satisfactory. Good at 52k (the price at which I got the phone). The phone wasnít worth 76k when it was launched but at 52k it justifies itself. I have bought it during prime sales , aside from discount i have bought it by paying just 36k It\\'s the latest offering from I phone. Simply great. Camera is superb. The glass back looks ultra premium, though I would suggest you to get a back protective case as glass is fragile. Got it in white and had to pay 1400 extra but it looks the best in white. You are spending 60000 on a phone so what\\'s 1400 more to get the best Fantastic mobile. Nicely integrated hardware and software nothing ever comes close to an Apple product. Smooth touch no lag, face identification works well. Camera is good. Battery lasts for 24 hours with moderate usage. Superb audio and video quality and iOS updates are always smooth. The apps are wonderful.??Amazon delivery was on dot. the same offer is available at authorized reseller stores which happens around the time Apple launches a new version of iPhone. IPhone SIM CARD SLOT NOT WORKING right from the beginning. Dude i was confused first that which one i should buy oneplus 7pro or iphone xr, so i choosen xr for 40k on offer and every thing ia good but i am dissapointed with tha camera quality and display quality really i have iphone 7plus also but the display is far far better then xr and the camera is also better but i know iphone 7plus has dual camera and that\\'s ok but dude detailing is missing and also zooming is also missing we get digital zoom which reduces tha quality.... In my initial review, I said that the iPhone XR was the best iPhone for most people right, and my thoughts about it haven\\'t changed six months later. This is still the best iPhone in the market, offering the same smooth and terrific user experience as the more expensive iPhone XS and XS Max, but with the knowledge that you\\'re also getting the best battery life. In fact, the battery life is at par, if not better, to what the P30 Pro and the Galaxy S10+ offer and that\\'s saying something. I am facing cellular network issue with every new update. As per my understanding, Hardware is not compatible with the OS. I have purchased this Apple iPhone XR (64GB) - Black for my use. I got it during great Indian festival for 38,000rs. Great value for the price. it has a receiver failer problem It was my first iphone till date i was an android user . But believe me once you get over these phones you wont switch it away iPhone XR is still a great buy. The price VS performance ratio on this phone makes it a very sensible buy. If you donít care about the latest and greatest this one year old offering from Apple is a far better buy. Only down side on the phone are as follows:- Never thought about purchasing XR but couldn\\'t stop myself when i saw this deal . Taken sudden decision and bought this. Very much worried till the delivery suspecting that the product would be refurbished or duplicate. But amazon kept thier commitment, i received a brand new orginal iphone. First of all the Face ID is crazy fast and accurate even during pitch darkness. The phone is fast and smooth, you donít feel like you are having just 3Gb of RAM, it handles anything you through at it without a hitch. The phone does feel premium and at the same time delicate because the backside is glass,îas you know glass is glass and glass will breakî. The pictures taken from the camera are good but the lack of night scape sort of things is a con. Overall the phone is great, although the side bezels are thick, you get used to it. The LCD screen does not lack anything compared to the OLEDís in day to day usage. You just stop thinking those things when you are using daily. I was looking to upgrade from my iPhone 6 and was confused about iPhone 11 & iPhone XR. Decided to go for iPhone XR just from the cost perspective. Only from Camera and Processor POV there is an upgrade in iPhone 11 rest remains the same. Bought it for 45k during sale I had been using iphone 8 plus before and not a single time did I ever experience that phone heating up even after extensive usage. This piece however heats up to the extent making it uncomfortable to hold. If I use it for less than 10 mins, it works fine but any usage beyond that makes it hot. And on top of that, if the brightness level is set to max, its becomes an iron box(pun intended). Not expected off an apple device ! the screen has a slight dot at the bottom which i noticed while fixing guard. If it comes out as mfr defect apple will certainly fix it. but doesn\\'t seem serious, will take to apple while it is still in warranty to know more and update. Got the 128 GB model since an iPhone almost always run out of space and never have the option for an SD card like Android devices. Overall the product is good from face id to Liquid retina. One thing surely standout for me is its surrounding speakers, they are really good(as per my experience), i got impressed With the work they have put in speakers. Sound is loud and clear. M an iphone addict... my first was iphone 4, then 6 which my brother gifted me but this time i upgraded to xr with my own salary n m really happy ... specially the battery life.... and  As i dont use camera much so potrait mode is not of much use to me.. face id recognition very nice... though u dont get the feel of holding iphone as it little bit big and on bulky side as compared to my iphone 6.... rest fuctioning everything is smooth so i think its worth the purchase... and if u have iphone 6 or 7 than only go for upgrade as i did lot of research and 8 and xs and xr they almost similar except for few features.... I am more or less stuck with the iOS platform because of the iwatch since I love its functionality. Upgraded from my 3yr old iPhone 7, was actually waiting for prices to drop post September this year  but when Amazon came up with an unbelievable prime deal, I couldnít resist! Easy to use, serves the purpose. I was an android guy for like last 7 years before that was using blackberry in between switched to ios as i used iphone 5c but at that time i was a bit disappointed may be because quite young i was and a bit techie but now i use my phone for basic purposes like calls, whats app, email, social media n bit gaming n music so it really handles that well though i was a bit hesitant at first as i was used to of finger touch sensor but seriously face recognition is damn good it works like a charm even when there is no light, so if you want no nonsense stuff n if it suits your requirements then go for it as now a days even droids are equally expensive in-fact some are more expensive like fold, razr etc. so just listen to your heart and buy ios or android and you wont go wrong, though i got mine in an offer for ?43000 for 128 GB variant Purchased this phone for a friend and he is very happy with the performance of the phone. Camera quality and features are the industry standard. For anyone refraining from buying an iPhone because it has only a single SIM slot,  please be informed that this Phone does support Dual SIM if you use E-SIM. Airtel and Jio, for now, has E-SIM facility. For a more detailed review do visit my review website at excitedneurons(dot)com Awesome product !! Far better than spending almost double for Xs, XS MAX, 11 as the difference is only display and camera. Otherwise everything is same. It would be definitely a bigger upgrade if anyone is switching from iphone 8 or 8+ to it. The entire UI is different. Icing on the cake is the PRIVACY, its the utmost priority of Apple it seems. Without you face id, nobody can see even the notifications. Its a must buy product. I still donít understand why people are crazy about iPhone. I bough this phone for 42k in great Indian sale couldnít find much difference so for. Itís been a week now. My old android is doing all the operation faster then this which detected my face quickly. And that has fingerprint support also. I am also crazy about this phone. My friend told that he will never go back to android again. Thatís the one reason for me to buy this phone. Let me wait for one more month to become addicted.  Till then Iíll leave the rating to 4*. When you think that this phone is expensive, thatís proving that this phone is for royal customers :p. Go for it if you are affordable. I have received this product with manufacturing defect in it. Screen has LED bleeding problem. Contacted the service team of Apple and they are ready to replace. The iPhone XR is by far the best that Apple had to provide in the recent years with no doubt. Right from the camera to its horsepower battery backup, everything is top notch. I bought XR after 11 came out. I read a few articles and saw a few video reviews which said that the real difference between the phones was the camera and that it was negligible and not worth the price difference. My Opinion-I don\\'t know why people are saying it\\'s an excellent display, personally i don\\'t like the display at all, No doubt colour accuracy is good, Touch response is good, but it not that sharp, text looks blurry. I\\'ve been using my iPhone XR for over 10 months now. So far, everything\\'s hunky-dory. Thanks to amazon for giving it for great deal, iphone xr 128gb is absolutely fantastic, with good battery life, camera, and performance. Since 6 months waiting to upgrade from 6s, compare to 6s xr a bit bigger in screen size for me apart from that its a great device to use, thanks to the seller 3 years back got 6s from the same seller and it still works pretty well without any issues. I love this phone... especially since I wanted it for a long time... would recommend it for both apple owners and those looking to become iPhone owners...camera quality is amazing... was able to activate the esim without hazzels.. 2 reasons that I switched my old phone for...size was a concern initially since I was accustomed to only iPhone 5, SE, 6... lightning cable is a disadvantage  with this phone as the charging point n headset points are the same... but I knew it when I was getting it... so got used to it now I believe firmly that this is the Best Affordable Phone Apple has ever made!!! Battery life will surely amaze the buyer, I use to charge my iPhone 7 Plus at the 100 percent to my office at 10AM  and while returning by 7 PM it used to be approx 7-8 percent remaining. I use my phone for basic tasks and PUBG during break. Now when XR came to my hand the very first day I forgot to charge my phone to 100 percent and took it to my office at 62 percent. Amazingly it had 33 percent charge while I was leaving my office and I even played 3 evoground matches of pubg that day during my break. It was my dream to have long lasting iOS enabled devices which came true with this spectacular device. One should blindly go for it if performance and battery is your huge concern. Wow Wow Apple iPhone XR Looks Amazing In Stunning White Colour Thanks To Amazon For Giving For Best Price In The Market Love You Amazon For Quick Delivery But Packaging  Is Not That Great It Should Be In More Secure Packaging  When Comes To Phone After 8 Years I am Using Again iPhone Before I Used iPhone 4s Now Again Coming Back From Android Phones To IOS Makes mee feel Happy And This Phone Is a beast go for it . I was always an iPhone user  till 8+ , then thought of changing to note 8 I loved that phone too but over the period of time I started realising there is nothing like IOS and iPhone. After using two high end androids (i keep changing phones) I witched back to iPhone and OMG I must say it has even become better it is so smooth like a butter on pan and IPhone X r is beauty, Liquid Retina is awesome and beautiful will not make you miss oled also the battery back up is woooowww .  This is the first ever phone I bought thru AMAZON I was skptical but thought of taking risk and yes Amazon delivered what they promised thru FREEDOM sale got a very good deal for 128 gb everyday I fall in love with this phone .. 6.1 inches screen for a phone is pretty good, feels heavy, but all that pales in comparison after the actual features of the phone are unlocked.I was informed that phone can be tracked even when switched off as per the new ios 13 update, camera quality is better , both front and back , fast charging too is great, i like the idea that the body is aluminium made as compared to the latest which after checking and reviewing holds up better after drop tests, face id recognition is great, but need back up in the form of app lock for unauthorized usage.Overall a great phone, at a amazing price, do not miss the chance to buy it, even if you feel it is heavy on your wallet, you wont get such a good phone loaded with features else where.Its like how the iphone 7 was the benchmark for future models , same goes for this phone. Excellent deals offered by Amazon 38k after bank discount.......best iPhone for every aspect.......good camera ...... battery backup excellent......... looks elegant.....feels premium in hand.....and  one think i said to all , though it\\'s a 720p display but display is excellent quality.......there is no panicked about it....and also played 1080p video in YouTube.......so .....go for it.......this is best budget iPhone at this price point......thank you Amazon........ I bought 128g  at 57k performing much faster and more smoother experience on an iPhone. Battery life is above average. app switching is lightning fast. I love it <3 I phone always like a dream phone... purchased this  in diwali sale in 38 k rs. My previous phone was s8 moved to xr and no regrates. Thank you amazon i got iphone XR 64GB black variant for 38000/- on big billion day sale Top end model IPhone XR with the Price of 42k?? Extremely satisfied... I was an android user for 6yrs and this was my first upgrade to iPhone.. Battery Standby is just next to impossible in any smart phones these days, Face ID fab!(One dis - If I covet half of my face during bike riding, it doesnít recognise me??) Good phone. Go for it if you want an iPhone experience. Truth be told, I do miss a finger print sensor. But, at updating to iOS 13 the performance of the Face ID head become significantly faster. I will not recommend anyone to buy XR,if you are considering iphone from camera perspective. There is nothing to dislike about this phone. I forgot Android after using this. This is superior class,u ll feel it when you hold it. Don\\'t be a sad face for 3GB Ram, it\\'s better than 8GB Android. Facelock can recognize you in dark. There is no finger print scanner. But still it\\'s no issues First of all got it for 38000.  Great at this price but or maximum at 45k nothing more than that for this phone. I was previously a user of iPhone SE and was wonderstruck with its abilities. But due to battery life had to look at a changeover. However looking at the price was little suspicious whether the phone would be worth for the money. Here are the pros n cons... This phone is good , i got it at Rs.45000 during this diwali sale, but after using this i was bound to think on the various aspects : considering the Ram and ROM ( 3 GB and 64 GB ) in this case , is the price ok , i felt that its really overpriced, we can get more features in Phones like Redmi Note 8 pro which is priced at around 16K ( discounts and bank offer are separate) this means we are paying for brand name or goodwill price simply to Apple. Then why we are not going for One plus models made in china as Apple i phone is also made in china for your information. This is my first iPhone after 10 years of being an android user. This review is after using this phone for 2 months. The performance has been top notch, battery life is very good considering  most of my days are moderate to heavy usage I still find 20-30 % battery the next day. Camera is good too but at time you miss the secondary lens for portraits and portraits donít work on objects. I am writing this review after using this phone for more than 10 days now . I upgraded this phone from iPhone 7 . The phone is really good , worth a buy if its on good sale .  128gb - around 55k I am using apple from last 7 years. And never change apple phone frequently. I was using iPhone 6s from last 3 years but due to less space and batter backup, I need to upgrade it. I choose Apple iPhone because it\\'s in between AppleXS and Apple X. Hardware A12 bionic chipset with 3 GB ram give my phone high speed on top of 128GB space thrilled the whole experience. In this new apple XR I still missed the center button especially when I play the games. Camera output is an amazing especially back camera. Also would like to appreciate the battery backup, I hardly change more than one time in 24hours. Now I do not need to my battery back always along with me ROFL. The best decision that I took was to give away my Samsung galaxy S8 and get this phone. I was skeptical at first considering on paper specs and the obvious inferior display. But I used it in a retail store and I didnít mind the display at all. It was one drawback that i could live with if i was getting everything much better than on the android side at the price range. Iphone is good. It dont have fingerprint reader, only faceid and password. iPhone XR performs better than those specs that it showed in paper for XR. A reasonably good product if you are into the Apple ecosystem and don\\'t want to splurge. Looks great and behaves well too. Camera is quite good for its resolution. Excellent battery life. Thank god I got rid of my android phone, finally! Gifted my wife with this phone for her birthday. Thanks to amazon for the fast delivery and maintaining their quality standards. iPhone XR with A12 bionic chip with 3 GB RAM is fast. This is my 1st iPhone and I am very impressed with it\\'s performance, processing power is fast and iPhone is very easy to use and it fits in my hand very well. This is my first iPhone. Iím happy with the performance of XR. With hdfc credit card discount and exchange of old phone, it costed me 49.7k. Both front and rear Camera quality is great, battery lasts whole day with normal use. Face recognition is better than OnePlus 6T. XRís almost HD display  can give tough competition to major FHD phones, side by side you wonít be able to spot any difference. Display is so crisp, no eye strain. And ios is buttery smooth. XR is more value for money than XS or X Best mobile compare to other Apple mobiles Awesome cellphone i have ever used..i have switched from Android(OP) to ios..which I believe..it cannot be compared with any os we have  in market..coming to the device itís really awesome battery on an average use last for a day..i don not play any game..I mostly spend time on Twitter and on other apps...the only worst thing i find is the charging rate which really sucks...it takes appx an hour to full juice. Camera has been the best...not as good as of Samsung s series and note series  but for me its the best...face recognition works like charm... Its Apple so no comments on their quality and user experience. Fabulous purchase got it at 43K which is worth and enjoying it Got this iPhone XR 128GB in an awesome deal of rs. 42,999 thanks to amazon. need i say anything about this phone! it\\'s a bomb. i bought the product red 64GB varient and let me tell you its sexier than it appears in the pictures. camera quality is really good. the portraits are awesome even though it has a single lens. the bezzel looks a bit wide compared to XS and XS Max, but if you are upgrading from Iphone 8 Plus or lower you won\\'t find it different. The liquid display is really nice with wide range of colors displayed really well. i got this during the independence day sale for Rs.52K and its definitely a great deal. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED! To review iPhone! Probably the only one I could afford but totally worth it. This is the best value for money you can get. iPhone 11 has only a marginal improvement compared to iPhone XR. But the performance is almost at par with them. I had an iPhone 6s, which ran almost 4 years. Touch and feel you get from your iphone is unparalleled with any other phone.(I have used all platforms) I bought a iphone XR  ,Which has some screen and camera issues  ,screen is freezing ,Amazon custome r Care talk like we did mistake ,not gud behaviour called to amazon ,they asked to go Apple store,already visited there from apple support we got information battery already replaced of this IMIE number.I told them ,but they were not agree,they again and again saying go there,we cant replace it.we just requested also said we paid 50000 for that but they dont agree,so if you buying pn and you have any issue in phone even it would be damaged they are not going to replace IT,and this seller is selling refurbish product. Great phone! Best ux in the class, no offense android but why does my calculator need permission to access my contacts? Not sure whether genuine product. Bought it on the first day of amazon sale. Within 15days, got a vertical line in the middle of display- see photos. Have bought 5 apple devices in the past and never had any problem with any of them so far. Since the return window closes within 19 days have to now take it to apple service center. Seriously makes me thing about the originality of the product. Good phone. Great screen size. But apple still has not fixed low light shooting. It still looks like crap when compared to oppo or Samsung or the +one series. Itís incredible how we end up paying so much for an iPhone which still doesnít get its camera right. Battery life is good. Downside is the replacement of the phono jack for headphones with its lightning socket which operates both charger and headphones - which means you can only do one thing I just got my iPhone XR 128GB White phone. I feel am lucky to get 12% discount on MRP. In addition 10% discount on my Credit card. Also an 2% instantaneous cashback on a special day. Total paisa-vasool!! Got it after discount for 43000+ additional value of 4000 on phone exchange. Feels like got robbed by apple I bought it for 64990 and after 10 days of launching iPhone 11 the price of this phone reduced to 54990 10000 drastic drop. Its bionic A12 chip is good and smooth but battery performance is bad, and it doesn\\'t even have  Fingerprint sensor, the face detection wont work at all angles. Need to stop buying this apple product. The iPhone is a great phone, but I am really impressed with amazon. I recieved the phone in less than 36hrs and checked the warranty and coverage on the Apple website. Everything was right in place, turns out I was unnecesarily hesitant to purchase the phone online. Also got one year screen insurance free in addition to the heavy discount! †My review after one month of use Pathetic experience with this phone . Bought it for 60K and not worth the price . Assembled in China and lot many issues with battery and other features . Better to buy from stores which are assembled in India and are cheaper with better quality check . Learnt hard way to never but electronics from amazon . I hot this product with 37K during big billion sale  ,and the product is super but it is not for you if you are a camera freak . Back camera and front camera both are good but front camera night vision is not enough . Over all battery life is good . Potrait mode  photos also good (without having a dual back camera) Not gonna lie while I was transferring my iCloud stuff, the phone got heated up to the point where I had to switch it off and then start over again. The best camera and feel of security... This is my 4th apple product. As usual, itís apple works fine . Will easily can last upto 4 years. Battery- is just awesome, can last u full working day with heavy useage. My second iphone and 3rd apple product so i can clearly say that if you are the first time user of apple product then you will surely give iphone XR 5 star rating but if you have been a long run user then you will think twice to give even 4 star also to this, may be after demise of Steve jobs apple has compromised with its quality, where as in till 2015 there were no comparison with any phone with iphone but now few products are giving strong comparison to it, apple is now only encashing its name but it will not good for the future of apple because now a days consumers are more aware, and if you are not giving 5 star to iphone the. Probably you have dealt with a wring product, sorry but not completely happy with XR. May be i will think next time when i will be upgrading my phone. Best battery life in an iPhone. Awesome experience. Camera, performance and battery life is great. Totally worth every penny spent! 1.The battery life is good. I got a very bad product from Amazon. This was really not expected from Amazon. i don\\'t know whether its an issue from Apple or Amazon. From the day it has come it started giving me issues.Issues related Hardware like Distorted sound i.e. Other person cannot listen the voice clearly, voice becomes like mute, and Software Issues like Phone getting hanged [NEVER HEARD IOS HANGING], Not able to unlock the phone moreover not able to recieve a call. I am the first time user to the iPhone and got this sort of bad experience which was never thought of or never expected.I am really disappointed with the product.Also I think Battery Life can be improved. Camera quality and Face reader is OK. Thanks to Amazon for putting it on sale for 43K . Wonderful phone to have at such price . Battery life is perfect for heavy users . Although a double camera would have made it perfect. Honestly speaking I love apple products due to the simple design and fluid user experience with the products. I am a fan of black but i got the Product RED as part of the amount goes for HIV research. This phone is just awesome. Screen is really good and bright, you canít really make a difference between the screen and an AMOLED screen. I have compared them side by side. You canít really say the difference. Note: No fingerprint reader in the phone so please consider it as the review of face id. Received a faulty set, had to take it to a service centre within 2 months and they had to replace it with a new phone. Good purchase during the sale. I like it. Moved from 6 to XR, which makes it bulky in your hand. But i will get use to it. Battery backup is good. I love the photos clicked in Protrait mode. Good phone. Being a 1st time user of ios, i liked it a lot. Although the compromises made for this phone like inferior display, big bezels nd notch are cleary visible and annoying. Battery life is top notch although supplied 5 watt charger is a trash. Using my iPad charger to charge it fast. Camera gives dslr quality pics in daylight nd outdoors but night photos are below average. In total a good package to try out apple ecosystem. I purchased this phone from amazon during the freedom sale got it for an effective price 49k . This is my first iphone and honestly not regretting a bit . I was worried about the specs such as LCD screen and camera quality but it did not disappoint me this one camera on XR is 1000 times better than those Three cameras on my samsung A50 and the LCD screen hardly makes a difference its crystal clear and vibrant . The battery life is just beautiful it can stand for 48hours on a single charge . Overall it a good buy , Apple is never great with specs but the always kills it The phone was not getting power on.. It\\'s a fabulous product. I\\'m sure everyone knows it\\'s quality. Only one thing that I should mention here regarding the battery. I was definitely expecting a better battery life in the normal mode. It\\'s merely giving a day with normal usage in that mode. However, in the Low Power Mode, its giving a great battery life without compromising any regular features of the phone. My experience with iPhones was never bad but this time with iPhone XR the phone started hanging from the very first month, it has not yet been a month and is already hanging.. did not expect this from apple gadgets. everything else is good the battery life , camera but its a little heavy, heats up and has started HANGING. Since from a lot of months i have been waiting to buy an iPhone XR in great Indian sale and as more than I expected I bought this mobile for a huge price drop thanks to Amazon for that.I ordered on Saturday noon 1 Pm and I got the product on the next day early morning 7 Am a super fast delivery from Amazon. If you are an Android user, you will find iPhone difficult in many respects. Firstly iPhone is not google friendly. Google updates will not happen automatically. Many free apps found in Android phones are not available in iPhone set up or you have to pay dearly. And there are many moreeeeeee...... This is my first iPhone and I am being excited. Close to a month now and I am still saying my new iPhone. Hi Team, I dont understand why would anyone use any other phone other than Iphone.  God please forgive their ignorance. They know not what they are missing My iphone was excellent bt i want my iphone complete bill...in box I canít receive bill Waited for a long time to get this mobile Want to return but u are not accepting it.. Bad experiance on amazon... Really paying a huge amount and giving bad quality products.... The product is awesome i have brought the same in Sep & there has been no issues itís currently running on IOS 13.2.2 & the phone is very fast it also has e-sim which is a major plus point face recognition is very good without any hassle & the battery is good enough to take it for a day & half. As this phone was bought after APPLE TV + was released we have received a annual subscription free with the product from 1st Nov 2019 Pls pls don\\'t buy from amazon or any other site buy it from store because i got a defected xr its face id is not working and it is having heating issues and now amazon is also not replacing it This is my third iPhone and I must say - each time Apple introduces an iPhone, they improve a lot in each model. iPhone XR is one of best selling iPhone for year 2018. Its not that cheap but still standout in crowd. Its not expensive than iPhone XS but still have all the features same as other top models- only difference is OLED screen but I can live with that. Recently introduced iPhone 11 and XR have only one difference which is of Price. Most of the features are exactly same. Best Battery backup ever in an iPhone I must say. Soothing and flawless iOS.  Camera is more than average and very much improved as compared to previous generations. Glass frame back and front and very appealing to eyes. Overall, a satisfactory experience with this device. A must buy if are considering iPhone 11 but have low budget. Fingerprint reader given one star coz it has Face ID ??, it works lightning fast (even in the dark) , super build quality, battery backup is nuts (works for more than 2 days with decent use) , Camera quality is amazing for photography and videography. Preferred product over iphone X if screen quality is not the main thing to notice (doesn\\'t matter if you don\\'t watch 4K videos on youtube) Using an iPhone after 6 years. Have been using Android and the transition is bit difficult as I am used to having different functions. Happy with product, it is not as bulky as I assumed. Vibrant colour and smooth functioning. Delivery was also very quick. Looks: 5 /5 Display 3.7/5 ó but u will get use too it not too bad better than expensive android phones  (DONT BUY IF DISPLAY IS YOUR PRIORITY) Only face recognition and no fingerprint. I think the phone is very good. Screen could be little smaller However these days only big screen phones are being launched so lets wait for future. Heyaa! I just purchased Iphone couple of weeks back and its been 15days of my experience with iphone! This is the first ever Iphone for me and im super excited to buy this....here goes my quick review in brief about the entire phone specs! 3 years with iPhone 6s and never faced a lag or hang . Battery started draining faster obviously 3 years and heavy usage did that . It is very sad to say that Amazone allow to seller to sell the Damage iPhone to their site,.I purchase iphone XR but after receiving it is found that speaker was not good,vibration problem and camera quality was bad.I contacted to Amazone customer care but they refuse to do the same.î, Amazone customer told  that everything ll be look by iPhone care.I went there and they told me to submit the phone.They r not Exchanging  the same.Its been feel like I m using 2nd hand phone.Really very disappointed. Itís good to be back with Apple and IOS!! It\\'s my first iphone ..i had also read a review about this phone which made me convinced to buy this particular product and model,though color yellow is my own choice,actually I wanted to buy iPhone 11 but when I read a review about this phone i got convinced bcoz sometimes it\\'s really difficult to decide between to best things. Guys whosoever wants to buy iPhone 10 xr plz go for it it\\'s a beautiful phone with all latest feature. Picture quality, screen touch, face recognition,battery life every thing is perfect,And trust me u won\\'t regret..!!??. Great deal.. Got it for 42999 for 128 GB version Pros: I had s4 and SE...bought this because it is from apple..I am not a techie.. now I like SE I received the phone on 21.10.2019, the phone operation was fine till 23.10.2019 and from next day it showed NO SIM after that all other sims were tried but the phone always displayed no sim installed and never worked again, this is the first time I had such a bad experience with Amazon, I was very very upset and today handed over the I phone Xr 128 GB to the authorised service centre in Kolkata, their response was not very positive and they will give feedback in 4-6 days time. Fantastic Apple phone in this price range. It is genuine and good phone. Esim facility is not working. May have to check with the service provider as well. The name Apple defines everything. Awesome phone. The delivery was on time thanks to Amazon. Good battery life and attractive design,  amazon offered great discount so went for it,  little heavy but that\\'s OK.  Overall very nice product Thanks for Amazon for genuine product and safe delivery. Couple of month back i bought this mobile for 55,999. I am quite shock to see the reduction in price. However, The mobile works absolutely fine and truely a flagship phone. Smooth UI, Outstanding camera and average battery life. Delivered with in 2 days, Thanks to Amazon Prime. Best iphone out there coming from iphone 6 , XR just blown my mind away . Below are pros n cons of the phone Phone not working. Phone was autotyping and then eventually frozen screen. I bought on 15th oct and barely used for few days. No support from amazon for replacement for defective piece. One thing to note that when I received this piece, it was in a locked bag. However, there should have been some QR code on bag which the delivery boy scans. There was no such code on the bag and the delivery center sent the qr code as whatsapp on my phone. Indeed a great phone. After a month usage I can say following: While on call, if you want to see the screen, it takes time to turn on. So if you want to disconnect or add another call, frst you have to wait for the screen to turn on.. which is very irritating. One canít even press the home button as it is not there in xr. Even aftr pressing power key, screen doesnít turn on immediately nd pressing it twice results in disconnection of call. ???? Thank u amazon for letting me hv this phone for under 40k. Everything about the phone is exceptional and for a change battery is excellent. Camera is good too and with dual sim capabilities the phone is sure a winner. The 11 is the same phone with just dual camera but 20k higher. So it didnít make sense to buy the iPhone 11. iOS 13 is a failed attempt from apple. The phone doesn\\'t have a smooth wifi or network connectivity. Its worse than some other phones half the cost. Absolute disappointment. Even older phones like 5s and 6s don\\'t show network issues while the iPhone XR has these issues. Apple support is clueless and can\\'t solve the issue. Disappointed with this apple product. All else is good just that the phones connectivity which is the most important thing for a phone is atrocious. Avoid if u can. Iím very happy with this Apple product except call records. I didnít find any app that suits my iOS XR in the store, rest everything works well. Everything on this XR works extremely well but the only problem that i have faced is that there is some kind of manufacturing defect in the camera lens.The photos shot have a black spot kind of smoky.Its only visible when something bright like sky or white wall is shot.Also,Iíve wiped the camera glass many times so itís not on the camera but the inside lens.Guys,phone is quite good just be careful while purchasing can happen with anyone. I have been using iPhone XR for about a week and I am impressed with the purchase and the phone has met my expectations. Here are some of the facts: For: Great battery life for an iPhone Pros - good screen resolution, camera quality, battery back up is good. Good screen size. I purchased this phone (Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black) during the Amazone Deewali sale, working fine and no issues so far. Installation and configuration was pretty easy as my previous phone was also iphone. I have checked and verified the product and it is a genuine one. The convenience part  is copying contacts, photos , audio & video files took less than 2 min. In overall,  phone is  good and i got it for around 50K with a Credit card refund offer of 2.5k back after 3 months. But I didnít receive the refund so far. Spoke to bank and they advised to get in touch with Amazon. Not sure where to reach now. I was a bit skeptical about buying it on Amazon. But happy to say..No regrets at all on this purchase. Works exactly as advertised. Absolutely no issues at all. Great battery life, nice photos. While the other variants of the latest iPhone have oled screen, this one has an lcd screen. But I don\\'t think it is making a difference to me. The screen quality is excellent. Overall very satisfied with this purchase. First time iOS user. Shifted from android to iOS finally Reviewing the device after a months of usage. Battery life 5 hour and heating too much...Amazon se na kharide phone Sayed discount ke Naam pe refurbished phone dete hain....iPhone me heating problem samanya nahi hain....mera phone change kardo amazonwale Nice phone got it for rs44000 after discount.with no cost emi from Amazon icici credit card. Red is beautiful. Battery back is good last for more than one day in my case. Performance, quality And finish awesome. Got update to iOS13. Amazon super fast delivery in 14hrs. Phone was covered with innovative tamper proof packaging and a code ,otp was provided to me by sms before delivery. Code to me matched with code on packaging. There\\'s no fingerprint sensor as its Iphone X series..face lock works good even in dark. Display is good fully visible in outdoors. Nice battery backup. Dual sim makes it awsome i.e one E Sim and normal one. May pay nominal fee for esim to operator. Currently only Jio and Airtel support esim..so please consider that. I received this product with slight scratch on the camera edges. It can be easily noticeable and My 1st iPhone. I liked it. Only difficulty I find is I didnít get much variety Of cases and cover for this model. You have to use for hands to handle this phone because of its size and skin. I purchased it in sell at Rs 46k in Nov 19. I prefer volume keys to be in right hand side and music aux cable on top which makes a mobile easy to handle and operate I had purchased the Mobile for Gift to My Son. When I started it on 23rd Oct I found that the some of the functions of the Mobile are not working. To my disapointment I could not return as it was not showing the option. The return period was valid but could not return. I bought a Product Red iPhone XR in the Great Indian Amazon sale in exchange for my 3 year old iPhone 7. I got the 128 GB version for ? 40k. Best value for money apple device right now got this iphone xr for 38k steal price totally worth it i am not an apple fanboy i use my oneplus 7 along with this device the softare smoothness is unmatchable camera is great and brand value is superb but main cons is slow charger it takes almost 3hr to complete the charge and display is also good but flat/accurate colours but i like the saturated one of my 1+ 7 but the quality is very nice closer to 1080 full hd panel for so under 45k is the best apple device you can get but if display is your main priority than oneplus 7t is a better overall device along with fast charging in this price range I checked the IMEI with Apple once i got the phone and it is genuine Hi, i have purchased this phone on 27th sep,  as i am prime member so i got this product on 30th sep.  I have created apple i. D pass word..  Since morning the very next day of product received..  Today is 1st oct 2019.. In a single day..  Even not completing 24 hours..  It is getting hang..  And it took time to almost 4 hours to unlock my device..  Even though i was not able to unlock my screen I have been using this Phone for about 5 months. I had used 5s and 6s plus. This phone is definitely a Big Big upgrade from former models. Itís brilliant in every possible way. The two main concerns which I had earlier with iPhones were battery life and secondary SIM card. Iím happy that finally Apple heard us and released this beast. You might wonder about thick bezels and LCD display on this phone. I bet you donít notice them at all when you get along with this phone. No wonder why XR is the best selling smartphone worldwide. Battery life is excellent. Enough of reviews. Just go for it. You wonít regret at any point of time! A superb smartphone at this price range, bought k20 pro a few days back but wanted to get an iPhone, got it on the early prime member sale at an amazing price, everything is perfect, except for the camera which shows a yellowish pictures everytime rest of all battery, screen performance is what I needed the most and this didnít let me down. Thanks amazon and apple for timely delivery and a best product †Everything is awesome except battery. This does not seem to be a genuine product. My phone goes completely silent many times and i have to restart it. The seller is not genuine. Better go for other sellers or offline. Really super experience,simply best quality,since 10 eyrs I used android and now feeling ios and iPhone quality,before I used Samsung S9plus which bought for 65k now itís awailable for 28k means 25k worth product they sold for 65k.So my final  openion is shift to ios and iphone xr is value for money. Best battery life amongst current iPhones...lightning fast with the most current A12 processor...specs are almost at par with the iPhone XS/XS Max...except for the camera and display. All in all...excellent price/value equation. I purchase in amazon festive sale at 40000 which is great but if one buy under 50000 at that price also it is amazing I\\'m regular Amazon buyer for many years now.Got my first iPhone xr delivered on 7/10/2019.But sorry to inform it stopped working from 21/10/2019.Amazon delivered Apple phone which is a most trusted brand in world.Dont know whose fault it is.I contacted Apple authorised service centre ie. Icare  who has d mobile to Bangalore.And now I\\'m waiting for their reply.My trust on Amazon is affected Product is good what we bought from Apple store but what Amazon delivered is not good  I suspect this not good quality product Amazon delivered during sale  with in a month one day this iPhone abruptly went off ND I was not able to on it again Very beautiful phone...very long battery life, superb camera quality...thanks a lot Amazon for such great discount during prime day sale n for making it affordable ...very happy with my purchase?????? The phone is a little big and handling it single handed might be a problem but size matters ! The display and the face recognition is awesome Still now doing great . iPhone XR is a great phone , upgraded from iPhone 8+ , n i am totally satisfied. Yellow is a beautiful colour but the only con is the side bezels n aluminium frame colour. Good battery backup so far. Little bit heavy compared to my previous version. Face unlock feature is a bit irritating sometimes as it gets unlocked sometimes when u donít wanna do it Well Iím writing this review after 3months of usage. Writing this review after 1 week of usage. Purchased the 128 GB version during the freedom sale for 57k. I was confused between One plus 7 Pro, IPhone XS and the XR and I must admit that it turned out to be a good decision. Its a classy product and feels premium in hand compared to other devices in this price range. The features that the other phones boast about are hardly being used in day to day life unless you are an avid gamer. The screen size is just perfect and quality is not bad as being highlighted in some of the reviews on youtube. Battery life is excellent, camera is very good and the phone is waterproof. Performance is excellent with A12 Bionic processor. I used to be an apple hater but no other phone ever matches the gaming optimisation of the iPhone XR/XS/XS Max. These devices with the A12 bionic chip just beat any other android devices in graphics rendering performance without a doubt. People have been complaining about the display that is basically 828p but trust me, you wonít even notice the difference between a proper 1080p screen and this one. In fact this screen looks better than most of the 1080p mobile phone screens (thanks to the liquid retina display technology it uses). The camera is amazing in all aspects and one of the best out there in the smartphone market but it canít click portraits without detecting a human face (P.S. you can download an app named halide at the appstore to click non human portraits). After 2 weeks of usages I am giving my review: Very good phone but can be priced better as this can be considered as low in value for money otherwise Best budget phone from Apple with better image stabilisation similar to iPhone XS. Battery life is extremely competitive with one plus battery\\'s lifetime. One of the best iPhone ever. Features are fabulous and battery life is excellent. On an average it lasts up to 10 hrs if you are an extensive phone user. This includes data usage and voice calling.  Bit heavy I comparison to other iPhones or android phones but might be thatís the trick itís good on battery life. Iíll give 10/10 The camera quality is not as good as I excepted it to be. It forms grams in the captures which is very evident when the pictures are projected on a monitor or a tv screen. Battery life is superb, goes more than 36 hours with normal usage until it hits the 20% low. Face recognition is perfect. Everything else is quite well except battery consumption which does not lie with the promised service that is upto 25 hrs of talktime (wireless) and upto 16 hrs of video streaming (wireless), at all. Hi, The device is good as it has everything what people look for in this price segment, i have used both i11 and XR , 11 is best because it has new processor rest XR is also a good option. I have received this product  on 1 Jul 2019, Since then i am experiencing difficulty with wi-fi Connections (taking some time to connect, not connecting spontaneously, not detecting other Wi-fi connections). Face ID not working properly (taking time to detect).  I was thinking Amazon sold the one of the damaged product. Very  bad experience with such a costly mobile ordered in Amazone Got.the product today, heating up very fast , and also not connecting to Android and other equipment. Not performing when trying to upload to cloud, etc. Connectivity issues.  Amazon says no refund , am in the.process of cancelling other buy orders. Was using X 64gb from last 2 yrs, apart from OLED display things are pretty much the same Awesome... iPhone XR is brilliant perfect value for money phone giving all the specs of latest iPhone in a reasonable price. Packs the same display, screen & pixel density as iPhone 11 only difference being camera upgrade & A 13 bionic processor rest almost everything is same. Excellent battery life, display in iPhone XR. The White Colour looks simple, sober & classy unlike dull creamy white in XS or XS Max last year. All in all a very good phone & thoroughly satisfied with it. This phone really feature-rich. Terrific Purchase. Initially there was a heating issue while updating software but it has gone now and working excellent. Coming from iphone 8, i really didn\\'t need this upgrade..but believe it or not..i am flattered..got a stellar deal of 40k for 128GB..camera is good from iphone 8..overall still it can\\'t beat my other beast Samsung Galaxy S10 plus..but here is the cliche..an iphone is an iphone. I was worried that it will be little oversized with 6.1 inch but fits well . Battery backup is good one full charge keeps it running for 1.5 days . Not tested camera yet . Got it in very good deal at 46k . Blue colour looks good. Third class screen and resolution, Very poor outdoor visiblity, network issue with dual sim, wifi drop/speed issue, slow data/ltr issue...slow charger included which takes ages for full charge... I am writing review after two months of usage. Great battery life. We\\'re getting a battery life of almost upto 2 days now. I was skeptical at first. Some people mentioned that they received fake of defective products. In my case, the product is genuine. I checked itís serial number on Apple website too. There is no difference in performance compared to people who bought from stores. What do I say about it. Night vision of camera is not at all good. Battery literally gets drain if we use mobile data for longer time. Yes but I have to admit if we do not use mobile data or wifi battery life is longer. Face recognition is not as fast as I was thinking compare to other brands with same features. But I loved my iPhone regardless of all this little issues. All the performance is good with all working features. and the main point was the battery backup of the phone it will minimun 1 and 1/2 day and another amazing think is i got no heating in this phone while i playing games like pubg mobile,cwc2 etc.Also a measure think is there is no comparison of ios with android. IOS is best in his performance. Overall its a good product, battery backup is little bit good compared to other iphone models.., Camera is Okay but i have seen mostly noise in the photos.Sound quality is as usual awesome, and I didnít tried underwater test but tried splash test, itís  up to the mark upon splash proof....I am using it since last 3 months I didnít face any problem...Go 4 It???? Switched to iPhone XR from MI A2 Amazon people are least bothered after giving a defective product.Such a costly product and i wonder how they can give such a defective Apple product and the customer has to run around with that.Amazon will ask to contact Apple support center and submit it there. and if you contact Apple customer care they will ask to contact Amazon. it just goes around like that.After submitting to Apple now amazon people are relectuent to take it back... its been 5 days without any solution...Please don\\'t buy iphones from Amazon...Worst experience... Its been one week since i bought it. I am completely satisfied with the product. Screen is quite big. Only and only problem is with the Charger. It takes 3 hours to charge the phone to 100%. Otherwise everything else is worth the price we are paying. I bought this iPhone XR in the Great Indian Sale from Amazon. Product was perfectly delivered and on time. Buying from amazon is safe and you get genuine products always. Guys i wud suggest u all to not buy the phone from the site as the one I have received is nt in its best condition..itís sensor is nt working properly n it hangs too at times n I have just received the phone just 15 days back I had never used an Iphone before and I was always sceptical about going for an IOS from android but after using this phone all I can say is IOS is on par with android. It is my red beast.... My first iPhone experience with iPhone xr is very smooth and awesome... I got is at only 38K many many thanks to amazon for this. Battery performance is good... with normal usage it gives around 24hrs backup while with heavy usage 12-13 hrs backup u can definitely get. But charging adapter  in the box is very pathetic. I just ordered an 12W fast charger at 1K from amazon. It is a smart choice to get iPhone Xr at 40K over iPhone 11 at 59 K (Including HDFC bank offer). With your saved money u can buy different apple accessories. Overall my first iPhone experience is awesome. This is my first iOS Not even completed 1 yr of this product and price reduced drastically. How you can decrease the price to such extend. I need compensation for that, amazon shall take necessary actions on it. got this for a superb deal, in fact way cheaper than mu prev 7plus which i got back in late 2016. Face ID works like a charm and the display seems great for normal usage. After 5 days of use,Love the IPhone XR Red ,Premium Top Class Phone,Got it For 38 k...Worth it...Camera Is Classy and Superb...With depth Control feature....Very Smooth...Display is good...Bit Battery is little low but compared with other iPhone it is good....Battery Standby is 10 hr when onscreen time is 8h 30m with always Data on with usage of FB ,YouTube and other apps. Face Unlock is so quick..Over all love to have this IPhone XR...Upgraded from IPhone SE to XR...So Battery is very much better for me...?????? This is my first apple product purchase, prior my mentality regarding the apple product was like a no Value for money company, but once I started using this phone the premium fell and the Sooth buttery flow type interface is way better than android. Happy to use this phone. Great phone. Not a gamer so donít care about the hardware stuff. Not a pro photographer so any pictures I shoot are epic for me. Not a loud person, so speakers on low volume for me work just perfectly. Battery life should be great like most apple phones do. Display is soft to my eyes so I like that. Apple interface is the best, so nothing much to say about there. Used for a day as of now. Awesome phone. Snappy and fluid in use. battery backup is pretty good (around 8 hours of screen-on time) with continouse data-on (youtube 1.5 hrs). Using 18W adapter which charges it fast. Brought 3.5mm jack connector to lightening separately. Rest all good. Will review after few more days. Thanks. I don\\'t like the  features of iPhone XR after paying huge amount. It\\'s battery is drained very fast . Side buttons are not comfortable while holding on hands, it pressed automatically without knowing . One-Two times it has automatically dialed the number when it was in my pocket. I think old version of iphones are  much better than this phone. I wants to return this phone but don\\'t find any option in Amazon. Anyone please suggest how I can return it. I bought it 28 days before. There is no fingerprint reader on this phone as its replaced by face recognition which works fine. User interface is same as my earlier iPhone which is excellent. Coming to battery life...it is simply amazing. Second time I shifted to Apple . But this time it was from One Plus 5T . Speed wise, battery wise, photo and video quality wise , fast charging , everything One Plus was better .  XR hangs also sometimes while receiving calls . But it was never the case with One plus . I received in original iPhone sealed package.  For its price, its best possible iPhone in market. Look and feel is great. Very fast responsive while using. Camera quality is 5-Star, Portrait pics are crisp clear. Watched some 4k and HDR videos on this iPhone, stunningly beautiful with tru color and deep contrast on this display. Its Amazing iphone, Thanks Amazon. This item is faulty. Make a sure first . Using this phone since last 20 days...first time iOS user...spending this much money not worth i have purchased @ 43000.00.purchased it because i have not used apple before...those who r buying it just because of Apple logo..pl don\\'t go..those who r enthusiastic for technology must go for it...i m a simple user not very technical not very camera oriented...a simple redmi user..i m not saying phone is bad but doe those who don\\'t have much usage with regards to its unique features should avoid this... Amazing What is the main purpose of the Phone? To make and receive calls, right. This phone has a defective microphone so call quality is damn poor. You have to speak very close to the microphone for the other person to hear you. All other feature works quite well. As for photos, even Poco F1 takes better pictures. Applez just a brand as was Nokia and Blackberry once. After using one month best camera and battery backup. I browsed a lot about this phone all were saying it has a LCD display and which is older. Serious problem with the lower mic, after spending all that money in this faulty crap just after two months you finally feel that you are the biggest C* in India who is buying an iPhone. Fragile product, connectivity issue, software issue & restrictions  all the type of minor issues have been build up causing a serious issue. Think before you waste ya hard earned money. Apple products are degrading their quality to keep their stocks and shares up. Good deal and worth buying for iPhone customers non iPhone user please don\\'t buy as you will not find worthy but as a premium product its very good and feels better in hand superb quality Bought it In white 64gb variant...looks are premium and has a large screen...being an lcd screen it far much better than other phones in competition...u get about 56gb of usable storage which is quite ok for a minimal user...performance is amazing and camera quality is average...must buy if you are looking for a budget iphone specially on offers Well Apple products deliver quality and apple I phone xr is just another fine product I bought few days back which is their lowest model in iPhone x series. Well for the specs and lcd screen I really feel it\\'s over priced that\\'s reason it gets one star less. Happy with the phone, initially I was scared to buy as it is expensive, and reviews were making me go on doubt, but the product came in a good condition,phone is superb. Thank you amazon for fast reliable service I am giving this review after few months of use of this phone. Apple never disappoints you. As i have shifted from Google phone to Apple, was bit difficult to shift from android to ios but now i am used to it. So many hidden features which u can find it out from you tube. Camera is awesome. I also learned some extra tips for photography from youtube and it is awesome. The speed of the phone never disappoints you after loading full 64gb data into the phone. Overall phone is awesome. Itís as good as buying from the store. The plastic cover which covers the box had a cut and small piece missing . Due to bad handling may be . That was disappointing to see. But then again the box was all sealed and itís ok . Nothing to complain I was more satisfied with my one plus 6T than this. Picture customization is not better than that phone. Without comparison it\\'s ok. Battery life is good than other iPhones and the app size in store is very less compared to play store so even with 64 gb it\\'s good. This product is not adequate in terms of its quality & performance. Itís screen creates problems in eyes i.e. not comfortable for eyes. Very very bad product. Totally disappointing. Very very bad item delivered by Amazon. Heat problem is there with my iPhone XR. Amazon Sells fake iPhones. Not satisfied at all. This iPhone has also hanging problem. I like the XR. This review is more for people who have yet to graduate to buying mobiles etc online. This was my first time. I had heard all sorts of stuff. But Amazon THANK YOU! Delivered in a tamper proof packing! With the assurance of a ten day window to return. The phone is working just fine! The accessories and the packing not at all good. I have used apple products, earlier packing and accessories are very good quality. Seems apple degraded the quality may be they have ordered from China. Not matching the standard of apple. Very bad experience in this iPhone XR. There are so many issues in this phone like when I click on airdrop icon then phone freezes and I have to force restart to get it working. Quality at its best . You buy it and if you want QUALITY, with best user friendly interface and camera . List goes on . Its the best . Thatís why u are here . Donít think again and again . Click buy . You wont regret and yes u want it. ?????? Excellent choice from iPhone family , only sad they drop the price around 10k 2 months after my purchase. I missed the chance, lucky new customers. I used it for 1 month. I am very happy to this i phone xr mobile. Very good and very comfortable mobile for good battery health goood camera and good Processor proformence. No any mobile Completed to i phone . Very good privacy and ezy to use u must by This is my first iPhone. Though itís too early to give any review about the phone  as I bought it recently but  till now Iím very impressed with iPhone XR. Go for it. Well, it has been more than 2 months now and the phone has been getting compliments. It\\'s the first iPhone that I\\'ve bought and I should say that the money you\\'re paying for the phone is mostly for the brand image. Can\\'t believe I got this phone for Rs 36,000 I have bought it around a month back. Used it and then writing a review. 3D camera not working .. cannot setup faceid .. always displaying Face ID not available error neither front camera portrait working .. please help donít have a clue where to go for help The most positive aspect of XR is battery life in my usage of 6 months. Downside is weight especially if you are upgrading from iPhone 6 or 7. Quite heavy due to big battery. Make sure you upgrade to iOS 13 and use the feature to optimise battery charging for longevity of battery I upgraded from iPhone 6 which I had used for 2.5 years. For me iPhone XR seems super smooth with amazing speed. I am still getting used to the absence of Home button. Using the regular charger, the phone takes nearly 2 hours to fully charge but charge lasts for more than 1 day for my regular usage. Phone is slippery - so I have added a Spigen case as well. On the whole a good iphone. Amazing product, fell in love with IPhone.In short I can tell this product is dam equal to premium 48-64 mega pixel camera phones in market,even bit more.I got it for all time low price 38000/- Flawless product, really good product thanks Amazon received the perfect without any default or any. Mobile performance is awesome as I have upgraded from iPhone 6s to Xr feeling great and enjoying the new features face unlock and others. Face unlocking is very fast and quick compare to other android phone 5 ?? from my side?????? The product was intact. Great packaging. The phone feels amazing. Itís my first time using an iPhone and I really think the XR is worth it if you want an iPhone that doesnít burn a deep hole in your pocket. Itís my first iPhone and I am totally happy with it. One thing that iPhone XR is having a best battery backup. And I love the performance. I was having a Redmi Note 4 device previously. It was having a 4 GB ram but itís performance was not up to the mark. I am surprised how iPhone is handling this kind of performance in only 3 GB of RAM ?? Not happy with battery life. Rest everything Is fine. Just loving the XR and is super value for money. Camera quality is really good and screen size is just perfect for watching videos and doesnít look bulky at all. Only downside is that the Apple logo at the back on the black colour isnít visible to the naked eye so prominently. Best iPhone after the 6s model. Not bulky, not big, this is a perfect sized iPhone. Display is crisp and clear. Smart hdr photos are great. It was a steal deal for me at Rs. 37999 during special sale. Delivered within 22 hours of ordering. Got it for ?37,999 and at this price it is the best phone. Though a little bulky and heavy but itís fine. Camera quality, battery life both are best features of the phone. No fingerprint sensors are drawbacks. Little bit heavy than OnePlus 5T. Never used LCD screen feeling odd for a while but it\\'s worth for money. Built is very strong. iPhone comes with some unnecessary apps I will delete it later. Excellent camera and phone build. There is no finger print reader in this but Face ID is ur answer for all this. Works great and secure. Battery is super better when compared to older iPhones and lasts more then 24 hrs with calls music Bluetooth devices connected and browsing and social media. Pretty satisfied so far. Overall Iphone XR is far better than X and other predecessors. Processor is way fast than others, build quality is awesome ,face recognition is too quick and the feel which you get by holding it is superlike. One suggestion to Apple that they must include fingerprint sensors too for more effective security. Bought it for 49999 on sale and it\\'s totally worth it. I\\'m using iPhone for 1st time and totally in love with it. As iPhone is famous for its camera quality and it\\'s true. Only problem is that it doesn\\'t have the fingerprint lock. Iíve been using this phone since a week now and i must say its totally worth the money! Just go for it! Device was heating too much after just a little bit of graphic works on that. Camera was too bad , front camera is no where matching the quality of IOS. I was totally disappointed with that device , I think they sold me the defective peice in the name of sale on your platform. This kind of professionalism is not good . I believe too much on Amazon but later on that I am not giving any bulk amount of order on this e commerce platform. Sorry for the comments if it hurts anyone. I bought 2 iPhone XR both are awesome. Canít really say much the phone itself makes a statement. I just loved it and I think the only thing that is lagging in this product which is the oled screen is not an issue at all , the quality of the lcd is way too good and as long as you are not too obsessed with every feature to be the latest and best , go for it , plus now they are offering at a way better price , definitely worth it Camera quality is good. 4/5 stars. Rear camera at night is awesome. It gives the effect of DSLR. Front camera is of average quality, grains when taken photo. But apple camera gives the natural effect to your photos! Itís been about a month using the IPhone XR. Was too enthusiastic about buying this phone. Front camera deteriorating everyday. Front camera quality is supper flop, even worst den any minimum range android phone. Rear camera is also not at per. Face detector not so good. No finger print available hence facing problems most of the time. Overall Apple releases a bad number with this variant. Got this for 38k and received within 2 day of placing order ....Apple FACE ID is the most secure way of unlocking your phone which you wouldn\\'t get on an another phone...camera is also top notch and is the same camera which iphone XS has got  but without the 2nd  telephoto/wide angle lens....overall quite happy with the iphone xr. I upgraded from my iPhone 7 to XR and Iím really happy with the performance looks and all the new features. Battery life is awesome and face recognition works perfectly even in dark. Total value for money and it goes without saying as it is an Apple product. Iím so happy to say, itís an authentic/genuine Apple Product. Will definitely buy again. Amazon actually gives you better discounts than Resellers. Received it yesterday, transferring data from my 7 plus took a couple of hours( maybe because of net issues) but everything on my old phone came on this XR. The camera is truly amazing. Go for it. Excellent device.Value for money. I already have iPhone 11 . I bought this for my friend there is not a single difference when compared to iPhone 11. Phone display,performance,everything same as iPhone 11. Iím pretty much satisfied. Liked display, camera quality, response etc. battery life is not great compared to 5000 mih Android phone. 18 hours from full charge. Itís price dropped to 39000+discounts within 20 days I purchased at 52000. It seemed to be cheated. A huge -ve impact for further purchases. Site as well as apple have to manage all things regarding it otherwise both will lose their credibility. No doubt product is good but these huge fluctuations in price ruined whole prospects of the product Has every thing you might be looking in an iPhone except the oled screen camera is as good as iPhone Xs with few limitations. If display is not a big concern for you you can\\'t get a better phone than this at this price range. Amazing camera in bright light. Average to poor performance in medium and low light conditions. Great battery. Privacy protection is an understated advantage. The iPhone XR delivers fast performance, great cameras and longer battery life than other flagship phones, all in a colorful and affordable package. Everything is well checked and warranty looks legitimate. Absolutely genuine product without any doubt. Bought yellow colour, feels mango in my hand. Getting a worthy case is real challenge though. After Using IPhone 6s & OnePlus 6, IPhone XR 128gb is juz awesome in face recognition battery life & user interface, Compared to IPhone 11 lesser in cost  both are in same size & same 4G ! Such a good iphone for such a great price. Its just a phone with good features, if switching from android you will love using its interface, a pure secure platform and flawless running experience. Excellent product, 100% original! I bought iPhone XR 128gb in the month of October, I was double minded to buy this product as all know online products will never reach us perfectly. But my assumption failed with this product. in one word I forgot android.. lovely phone This phone is a beast. Man,the phones touch response is just awesome and iOS is so buttery smooth. †This is my first apple device in terms of phone. The phone is totally worth it (every penny).  The colour, camera, design, sound quality everything is just way beyond perfection. Got It for 38k. Ditched One plus 7T for this and I am very happy with this decision and ya screen is great but you will feel difference if you are coming from 1440p display else it is great. Great phone camera is good ,battery is good , but it take too much time to charge , company #APPLE need to give fast charger in box. And one more thing the weight of iphone xr is little bit more than other android phone.  Other wise phone is great.......gaming performance is great?? †Just want to say GO FOR IT! I got it for 39,999 in the Amazon Great Indian festival and let me tell you, it arrived within 24 hours. Even though iPhone 11 is here, it has the same exact screen and almost the same features except the camera. If you are a die hard camera fan, then go for iPhone 11. But this works for me :) Don\\'t buy iPhone on amazon The phone which a person need this is one for them. Really loved it everything in this price range bybapple it is very good product. But i m not satisfied with its display. Display quality and clearity is very poor 720p video play is not good so blurry THANKS TO AMAZON GOT DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AT FIRST FOUND SCRATCHES AND DAMAGE BUT AMAZON ALWAYS THERE TO HELP YOU GOT REPLACED QUICKLY WITHIN FEW DAYS AND GOT A BRAND NEW PRODUCT LIKE TO THANK YOU AMAZON AND SELLER ALSO DARSHITA ELECTRONICS IF YOU ARE THINKING TO BUY IPHONE GO FOR DARSHITA?? camera quality is just awesome and battery backup is soo great that give you a whole day use, smooth interface,in many reviews they said display is of LCD, but when i got my device, then i Relies even that iphone have LCD display but it is great viewing display, I have no regrets to buy that iphone XR. Go for it guys. Nothing to say about iPhone itís always the best phone. But this time i have to thank Amazon for bringing the cost down and affordable during great indian sale which says IRRESISTIBLE DEAL which really is a irresistible deal iPhone XR is Good and I am yet to use all features of the phone, I had used iPhone 5, 6s. Lots new features available . Itís a great phone. Cut some stars as the camera developed a problem after only 6 weeks. But Apple has fixed it. But it was unexpected and Apple and the seller must ensure that these things donít happen The phone conks off, donít think the OS can take load. Been just 2 months and itís already acting up. Not sure if the problem is with the device or orders from amazon. Display 4/5 I always thought to buy iPhone and every time I used to think that what is so special in iPhone but yes after buying iPhone XR I can say that no one can replace this. Starting from battery life to the screen which is standard and can be used one handed. Camera quality is also very good which you can realise after two three clicks only. So for me iPhone XR is a beast at low price among other iPhone models. Camera not that great. ORDER PLACED : 1 October 2019 Pathetic product, everyday reporting new issues and going to hangout every time. No questions about ?? other than its affordability, XR got a price cut and made it affordable. Overall product quality is awesome, only issue is at times its too hitech to understand. Apple ecosystem and almost latest specs for 40k. I purchased this beauty in big billion sale. Thus I got it at a remarkable price. The battery life is good so far and the speed has been pretty good. I love the overall look, size and design of this model a lot. The camera quality is great but definitely the higher version have a better camera quality experience to provide. I am iphone lover but always disappointed with battery back up. But after getting this superb phone my love towards iphone become more stronger. Amazing camera screen clarity, good time response, face unlock takes leasser than eye blink.amazing battery back up. Stunning look. Overall no need to purchase dslr camera. Spend money on it and u get phone for the lifetime. While so far all my iPhones before had a small write up about the licensing etc at the back of the phone. This XR does not have any writing. Phone is excellent...Thanks to Amazon for their service. But the delivery was pathetic, the delivery boy refused to deliver the product. I, myself went to their office to get my phone. Hope that it will not repeat in future. The camera quality in night is awesome..there are lots of features to do edit the pictures and videos. Other than that battery life is around 1.5 days in normal usage and 6-8 hours in heavy games like pubg asphalt videos YouTube play music etc. at the price of 43k itís a steal.... Received my iPhone within a week after place the order, Had issues with it but thanks to amazon for speedy replacement. Using the XR for the past 3 months and Iím completely delighted to have this model. Certainly a value for money product in the iPhone flagship category. Battery life is excellent, charging for one time in a day itself will have enough power for the remaining day. Camera quality is comparatively better than the other high end categories iPhones. Camera is very good .Screen size is just right for people like me who use phone for typing mails to watching Netflix .One can download multiple apps .Speed is good .Face recognition works like magic .Have been using iPhone since last 5 yrs ,and have found no reason to complain so far. It\\'s one of the best phones available in the market right now. Apple always gives the best products to its customers. It had A12 chipset which can do 5 trillion operations per second. It never slows down. It gives you the best phone using experience. Go for it, if you can buy it. Don\\'t buy Samsung products or OnePlus products they are just useless. Just go for the product. Review after 5 months of usage approximately. #1mobile of the my devices First of all I thank Amazon for such blazing fast delivery and the packaging was terrific. So trustworthy. Secondly Apple gets full marks for such a master piece. iPhone XR is capable of handling my heavy multitasking efficiently. So far so good. Reviewed after using it for almost a day. Thanks Amazon and Apple Superb phone. Got it at a price of 39999/- on Big Billion Day Sale Original product at the best price.... got it during great Indian festival sale at an amazing discount.. so far after a few days of use must say itís an obvious and noticeable upgrade for people using iPhone 7 and beyond .. camera quality is quite good if not the best ...battery life is just awesome ... I ordered it for my wife as she wanted to use IPhone for so long but was not willing to change her phone. could not find fingerprint reader. Otherwise camera and battery life are good. I like live camera in edit mode in camera. I have purchased this product during the diwali sale on Oct 22 and now the adaptor doesn\\'t work. A product worth 43k having an adaptor life of 22 days... I don\\'t even know what else to do now. Removed the sim and started using old broken phone since morning I am using iPhone from last 8 years. This model no need to carry power bank(for me) compared with iPhone 6s and 7 People who say iPhone XR has inferior display, please use before u judge based on specs. Iíve been using Pixel and recently switched to iPhone XR and I loved it. Battery life is unrivalled and Fave ID is charm. 5 star quality... 1st apple product for my wife and in the family, Very good phone, clear crisp sound quality, Amazing display ... Apple doesn\\'t compromise with it\\'s product. Highly recommended. This rating is not for the product.... Its for the seller... Who has delivered the product with scratches on the back panel..... Nice products battery life is very good. Camera is ok. Amazon delivery is wrost as i have to ordered it twice. In between i suffer loss of 2500 rs as price has been increased after best discount period has gone. I am so happy with amazon.!! Good price and get it on time and yes perfect original product..!! Iphone XR 64 gb  if you allrdy using iphone than u will love it and u buying is first time than u wll flll in love for sure ..!!! I am giving this review after using my iphone XR for more than month..!! So trust me guys its good and original product.!!! I just loved it! Brother just bought iPhone 11 and I thinks the XR battery life is better than 11 and 11 has heating problem. I loved the phone its fast fast and very fast with fabulous camera Not happy with the mobile , let me know if u guys can send new mobile or can give a option to upgrade to iphone 11 . Let me know what best can be done . The first thing you notice about XR is itís battery. Super long battery of more than 24 hours. Rest is exactly as it should be in an iPhone. Camera also needs a special mention. Great camera. Does what it is supposed to do. True iPhone, no exceptions. Gud phone ...camera is super.. iPhone XR does not have finger print reader as itís unlocked with face reading.. My infact upgraded from my iPhone 7 to XR. Itís been more than a month I am using it and has no issues. Amazon had the best rate and it is during the Flash sale , I picked it up at 49,999/-.  Their delivery was prompt and was prior to the committed date. My IPhone XR has a fantastic camera, a fast processor, exceptional battery life and high quality display. There is nothing much to say specially about iPhone. I have used several android devices and I switched to iPhone XR from OnePlus 6. Simply this switching is fabulous experience to me. Got it for 39000 in the great Indian sale along with exchange (redmi 4) and using SBI credit card. Anawesome phone. Once we use iPhone, android phones seem cheap. You start appreciating little details that Apple has done to make this phone worth its price and hype. If you can afford, then close your eyes and bye it. You will not be disappointed The box was not sealed and looked re-packed. I have used iPhone since so many years Got this phone at a discount price in amazon. Slightly heavy but good looking phone with terrific battery life. The phone is fast with a very responsive face detection. Genuine product received from seller Darshita Electronics.Everything is fine after 7days of use.One thing is the set getting heat whenever large file is being downloaded or playing game.Rest everything is just cool.Iím loving it. Awesome phone, great battery life it can last upto 2 whole days, face ID works great even if you are in dark room. Screen size perfect so that we can do tasks using single hand. Will get long term support. 5w charging adapter works well but it\\'s good to have 12w charger than 5w. Feel big for iPhone 7,8,6 users. I love iPhone XR very much. It is user friendly, top notch though there are compromises compared to the other models especially the flagship ones. Overall, it is a highly recommended phone for all the Apple fans and iPhone lovers. Thank you Apple!! Make sure you read all instructions, check package and then give OTP. the phone was brand new and is working great. had reservations about online delivery but this experience was seamless. Good to get this discount at discount. Excellent product.........iphone XR is jet fast. loving it. Awesom, getting 1day full and few hrs more. 3hrs of Pubg, 2hrs of skype meeting, calls msgs, songs, internet. Finally iPhone had worked on battery. This is all from normal mode.  Pow power  mode is even better. Dont go by the reviews that mention fake product !! Its very much iphone xr that i ordered !! How the phone is would b a very personal view point but itís definitely not a fake !! Thank god i went by my instincts and got a great deal Super smooth and premium product nice camera good battery life quick face unlock even in dark. Plays heavy games with high graphic settings without any lag. Overall a very good product There is a problem of signal. It is frequently going, where as other make mobiles are having good signal. Now the voice of video has also become very low. Not a good buy.  Can any guide where to report the issue. I like everything about this product. I ordered this iphone xr on end of festive sale and Amazon delivered the product in the given time period. Everything in this phone works good and fine , no doubts. Amazon gives 100% product to us, they never unsatisfied me. At the end Product\\'s performance outstanding . Amazon delivery also secure??. Really really good product..if you have budget of 50-60k you should definitely go for iphone XR..excellent batterylist last of 1 and half day..brilliant camera and superb portrait mode !! Ive purchased in 52k in amazon sale..it is surely value for money !! I like this phone. I got iphoneXR at very reasonable price. The apple company has made one thing better in this model i.e. battery life. The phone runs for 2days with full charge. there is no finger print reader in this model although face id is very accurate, it scans your face even in the dark. There is no doubt about the picture quality when it comes to iphone. I am big Apple fan from almost decade ??and they have never disappointed either on the hardware side or the iOS( operating system). Got this from amazon deal at very attractive price It is really a good one by apple. Easy to use and very fast processor. I just love it... and big advantage is it supports dual sim but now the price has been dropped to 54990 by apple in india Ya really super phone/theyíre confusing to(AirPods &Earpods) this phone with EarPods with lightening connector only not for Bluetooth AirPod ur clearly understand then u will pay I switched from Android to iOS through this and so far it\\'s been amazing, the battery goes 1.5 day with heavy use, camera\\'s awesome and the new iOS 13 gives all the features that you need. They gave me a faulty phone which i came to knew after one month, The product is excellent. Nice phone. Worth buying for the price. Only regret is the price went down by 3000 rupees within one day. I have not yet opened as the outer cover seems damaged After using it for 6 days properly . The phone started to hang it automatically restarts and gets stuck on apple log had to format my phone 2 time. Apple service center could not detect the problem . THEY Said it should be sent to bangalore for repair due to some motherboard issue . So i dnt want all that headache i want my phone replaced by a new sealed pack same iphone No lesser than iPhone XS Max At Rs 35,000 (big billion sale + exchange offer), its a steal. For phone review, go to google - there are plenty of XR reviews. As good as it gets What a phone . Display is not a concern ,it\\'s brilliant even it\\'s 720p.build is excellent . It\\'s a very pretty and good looking mobile. Performance wise, it is super smooth. Camera is as good as iPhone XS, portrait mode is also good enough.  And the best part is, being an iphone it has a long lasting battery. Though it has LCD, but you would hardly be able to find any difference between this and OLED. Size is perfect, infact everything is perfect and cool! The phone is definitely not performing per iPhone standards - frequent Call drops ( the issue is not with network provider ) and battery life is worse than iPhone 8. Back glass of Iphone got broken after one month of buying without any prior incident. Disappointed with the service provided by Amazon. If something happens to our product, Amazon will be saying to contact Manufacturer. Face ID is very very slow. There seems to be a problem with the microphone. There is an issue with the sensors. Microphone issues, touch issues. Iíve been trying to raise a complaint but the amazon support team is always redirecting me to the apple website. Iíve been unable to return this item since Iíve discovered the problems. I really need assistance on this matter. Great phone = great battery life + great camera especially in low light + great security and face recognition. Very happy and bought it at the right time before the prices went up again. Like the luk and fallen in love on firstsight. Feel great when unlookers give an appreciative glance. Invaluable asset. In portrait Camera - while taking a photo of a substance or anything (other than people)it always says ëperson not detectedí. portrait function is only for people , not for the object. What to say itís Apple amazing man but when youíre buying this mobile better you should buy a CaseAlong with it because the backside of mobile is slippery and made of plastic plus glass,,Worth to buy it This is the best product from apple till date. I just love it.it has got all I want.good camera decent battery life good sound etc etc.and the display do not give me any problems.if there is something to complain about it is the price. Superb smartphone. Certain features of Apple makes it completely class apart. Great battery backup, extraordinary camera quality, support of dual sim etc segregate it from the other brands. Best value for money in iphone . I am extremely satisfied with the purchase with no worry for storage for this 256 GB model. Wireless charging is just wow. Its a perfect phone, though a bit heavy coz of the metal body. I got this in red colour which is my favourite and its such a settled red, basically its a mixture of red and maroon. Camera quality is also good not the best as compare to other apple phones. Overall i love my phone as its a gift from my darling husband. Timely delivered. Gr8 deal from amazon. Few months back I ordered one plus mobile from same seller. They delivered original product. Simply love XR! Battery life is great and Iím not really missing the telephoto lens! Do buy product red as it support AIDS Research. The product is working fine. Just as expected from apple product. However there were two scratch marks on the sides of the phone just after unboxing which is very strange Itís always a charm to use iPhone. Ease of use and fast response are key. This phone is hanging n seller is not returning or changing this phone I tried many times but I have been an apple patron for a while.. I Started using the Iphone 3, 5, 6, 7 and now i bought the XR.. I honestly feel that its terrible.. Just a hype build around it.. The Face ID never works, the camera gets stuck on its portrait mode.. My honest feedback is not to but the iPhones anymore. Just will have to say that Apple lost itself a good customer.. Excellent phone I am happy I suggest u all to buy with amazon, because maintaining genuine sellers with good quality products and the biggest most important  thing is  customers support I am very much happy with amazon and their customers support. Hats off I bought a new iPhone XR from amazon and the delivery was within 24 hours. It was a brand new pack sealed. While I started using this phone, I realized that my takes much longer time to get charged. However, other phones I have get charged quickly from their respective cables. I am unsure about the originality of the product received. Not a value for money product.Apple is still giving 1amp charger with such expensive phone with almost 3000 mAh battery. The same charger is also  given along with 5s and also SE. Bought this cell phone for my retired father. He is a person who wanted a great battery life, good camera and great speakers with ease of use that is not present in any android cell phone in the market. I have got the product in one piece thatís true but this product is defected one. Out of two speakers one is damaged. I am regulars IPhone user since from past 5 years and thatís why I could point it out. Amazon - kindly notice The battery is not a 4000 mah  like many other phones these but still has a lot of life in it . This is my second IPHONE and the performance just outclasses any android phone Excellent-The best we can purchase with small amounts purchased for 42999/- at offer from amazon Osome product but I suggest get iPhone 11 updated version of iPhone XR. Beautiful phone. Great camera. I just feel that the phone gets heated a bit I guess I am not sure though as itís my first day on this phone and have been constantly playing online games Value of money is excellent but little costly evrything is good.problem compared with mi poco f1 Rs15000.waste of money.. I love apple products, have been using them since 2009 and this is the finest iPhone Iíve ever used. I received my order yesterday and the voice recorder is defective, have spoken to apple support, after troubleshooting they recommended I get it checked at an authorised service centre as it seems to be a defected piece. I bought this phone on Big billion day. It was well packed and the phone is very good. Battery quality and camera quality is  amazing. Those who do not buy yet and thinking for it, go for it, it will not disappoint you. Size is bit over, good battery life than previous products. If you were using iPhone 6,6s or 7 might find it bigger to hold because itís size is 6.1 which quite big for iPhone if you never used plus editions. Faulty charging cable it charges phone only from one side. When buying online check every aspect before actually using it The phone I received was defective. Please think twice about buying apple products as I faced the same issue with my MacBook Air. There is no solution provided by Amazon which was surprising as they use to have very good customer care. I feel I have wasted my money. The processor is not that speed as expected. Just received the phone and checked for the warranty on apple site. Itís showing that purchase is not validated...after 4 hours again I checked. And smile on my face. Apple said your purchase is validated and warranty Amazon is sending defective devices, please donít purchase. Best phone for those users who really need a very good battery life. Camera supreb and video stabilization is just fabulous. Go for it ????  A bit bulky feels like u r carrying a mini RDX ???? I personally like Apple product. But my charger is not as good as it shout be like an apple product. After a moth of using my charger stopped working. Overall the phone rates 4/5 considering the price of 49k for a128 GB. Camera quality is gud but just has the basic features and no advanced techs like the ones in oppo /Mi .Battery is gud .It will sustain a day for me (I donít play games).Call function is what worries me in this phone.It gets stuck all of a sudden while attempting a call. First off all I would like say, the delivery boy of amazon is very polite with consumers. Faceid not functioning after 15 days.phone freezes once selfie portrait mode is activated.Face it does not work anymore now Android no match to iOS. A gift for spouse, a bit on bulky side but an effective gadget I\\'ve been using this phone for almost a month a now and this is the fastest smartphone I\\'ve ever used. I know this years iPhone 11 is faster than this but after watching a tons of comparison videos on YouTube I\\'ve decided to go with the XR. I don\\'t think it\\'s worth the extra bucks and I\\'m very satisfied with this purchase. Amazing smartphone with best build auality and camera have amazing pictures and battery life is also good but only one problem back single camera after all money value product Before buying this product i was so scared that what if the product is fake or may be used. We bought the phone during sale period near Diwali. Its nice phone with big screen. Ideal for people who reply to emails or do a lot of work related chat on the phone. Batter life seems to be really impressive. It goes without charging for 1.5 days with constant internet connection. The phone had a software problem, the microphone wasnt working. WoW experience This is clear update for me after iPhone 7. Camera quality is awesome. But the most impressive thing is battery life , it was seamless. You could miss 3D Touch but itís ok . dont buy it as doesnt come with dual sim slot , for this esim required and in INDIA only jio and airtel provide e sim technology Value for money as good quality and money wise but price daily coming down in the market as Amazon price and market price is down dont have to say much,  apple is apple and makes best phones,  once you buy apple you dont want to try any other phone,  it is amazing phone Heating so fast in use after 15 minute of use Very very bad product accessories very cheap quality packing .....Also facing problem regarding warranty ........Just after 6 days of purchase ...Charger adapter and lighting cable ha failed ...And ...Apple care is also behaving badly ... Highly disappointed regarding .....Please give me a way to return my phone..... Really user friendly, user interface is buttery smooth..camera quality awesome( esp. portrait mode).. not sure how it compares to iPhone 11, Iím happy with this phone got a discount on hdfc card. bought it to gift some one else. As per the users response, its a good phone, works effectively Doesnot look like an original iPhone, keeps hanging its not even a week old. Doesnt take finger commands well n hangs continuously. Pathetic product. I need a replacement I am loving it...!!!! Upgraded from android Fingerprint reader is not there only face lock which is more than perfect Amazing battery life. Even on heavy use, the battery lasts the whole day easily. Iphone XR is super smooth, face unlock is fast and really impressed with the privacy option related to apps. Best iPhone to use for its 55K price This is my first iPhone XR.... After using the phone I realise why the iPhone is special....the features, screen touch, the look, are all awesome.... Happy To Be Purchase iPhone.... I purchased iphone for brand n its dual sim and i found it more value for money. The phone gets hanged during every incoming call .i practically have to cut it and call them back . NOT very please with Apple ,expected a better working phone for the price they charge. Bought it during the second great indian sale for 41k. Though 3k higher than the 1st sale I am very happy to buy it as I know itís a good deal. I am very much statisfied with the phone quality and delivery speed. But the packing quality should improve. In fact, the features and functions of this mobile are very good, especially the price is very low, which is 39 thousand only, and the mobile was delivered in a very short time, it is now priced at 45 thousand, An excellent phone. Does what you need at super speeds. Face ID is a charm. I think I got an excellent deal in the Dussehra sale. Only thing which has dumbfounded me is the colour. Looks orange on screen and more pinkish in real life. Solved using a Spigen black cover.  Should have gone for black. Received mobile through amazon while buying new set it self speaker ?? problem still not received any feedback from amazon they  just sold the mobile not taking responsibility feel very bad. There is poor customer support since the amount of I phone XR ?? Rs. 45k very huge. Have been using this fone since almost 1month, its simply adorable and a beauty (red colour)..camera quality is awesome, battery could have been improved a bit(16-18 hrs on full net usage).. In camera video and slow mo is not working properly and I havenít received any bill neither hard copy nor soft Feels good if you are using for the first time. Great feeling to hold iPhone :) Iphone xr came just today and it is having white line defect on my phone and amazon is not replacing my mobile i am feeling cheated i have spent all my hard earned money on iphone ?? I am very frequent user of Internet data, but IPhone XR battery is awesome. It long-standing two days. And camera qualities is also awesome. Itís value to money. Not completely satisfied with the product as the dual sim on iphone is way too complicated. Battery and camera features is the best of XR. I am facing difficulty in disconnecting / hang up the call, when I remove the phone from my ears, the lights didnít appear so that I can disconnect the call I need to wait for other person to disconnect the call from their end because there is no light on the screen. Most of the time the red button didnít work at all. Excellent mobile...bought it for 38000-2000(cashback)=36000rsesim jio prepaid working well..battery life excellent (1complete day for me) Been using it from the past couple of months the phone has been great itís my 1st iPhone as Iíve always been an android fan in the past , great battery life and very smooth . Can say itís totally worth the price . The product was just as good as an apple always is and the delivery was prompt. I am an apple user and I require all my gadgets to be in sync which is why I bought this. But always look according to ur requirement and then buy the phone that suits you best! Best iPhone you can buy at this price range. A pretty huge battery life, smooth interface and an outstanding camera. The phone is good donít had any issues,but in box contents they wrote EarPods and gave normal earphones which is wrong information...they wil not give anything even sim card placement pin also As the mobile is cool and fast performance and the interface is amazing as it is apple it feel the same all things are went good but only one bad thing its display as it is 720p display but slightly colour variable can be noticed but tho its good mobile at good price in apple A big change for me was moving up from iPhone 7 Plus to this phone is the Face ID. It is super fast and very accurate. If you are buying just because of the brand name then go for it, else it\\'s of no use. Upgrading from iPhone 6 (16GB) to iPhone XR (128) was the best decision I ever made. Everything is so perfect & optimize. Touch, display, camera, sound, processor, battery.. literally everything.  Apple needs to work on their latest iOS 13 though. (Also Iím getting more kills on PUGB:) Hands down to A12 Bionic. Excellent iPhone in that too 40k. Camera battery and touch is Incomparable . 128GB variant ,Used it for a month,Great performance. Excellent finishing and stylish. Face ID is powerful as it works even in pitch dark conditions. Camera is amazing . A bit bulky when u put a cover as the rear camera is significantly above the back surface of the phone. I got a different item This rating is only for the product not for  Delivery.  Till the last minute I was kept on my toes. The box was not completely in a sealed condition. Can Amazon answer for this? Coming to  Handset, No issues at all. It is simply amazing. One should know how to use it wisely. I would update my reviews after using it for few months. when i got this phone after unboxing i din\\'t get the proper accessories in the box headphone is missing Screen becomes unresponsive very often and there\\'s no way to restart the phone because the screen is unresponsive Best phone from Apple after iPhone 7. Nice phone Product is good. Face ID works fast. Battery lasts longer than previous iPhones, depending on usage it can last up to a day. For heavy usage and gaming the battery lasts up to 6hours. Camera is good in daylight use. Low light photography is grainy. Overall a good product. Finger print sensor is missing , the phone is bit heavy Good Priduct Face Recognition, Battery life & user interface is secondary. Itís an iPhone thatís it. Apple satisfies our high expectations. The Apple iPhone XR was Awesome. Really Worth it. I got it at 31900 /- with exchange my old android phone .i never believed in this low price I can get dual sim iPhone with latest chipset.thanks to amazon to providing great discounts I am a 6s+ user now upgrade to xR a good phone with nice camera, while being water resistant, provides a good battery even for backup for gaming. automatically restart some times Phone is super fast u will never shift to android after using iphones. Only problem that few apps are not well designed for apple like voot they keep lagging rest everything no need to explain I got this for 38 k. Good deal. Awesome to use. Unbelievable product..Crafted to precision...Mobile at its best...Amazon deal is mind blowing..best place to get an IPhone...Delivery is fast...Camera is excellent...IOS rocks...No second thoughts...IPhone is the beast to own..Amazon is the place to go.... Beautiful product, Got it @ ?38k during billion day sale. Battery, camera, face ID and everything works well. Slightly heavy and bigger, if you are not used to use large screen phones, but use will soon get used to it Needless to rate Apple any less. An year old Appleís A12 bionic still outperforms SD 855. And iOS, such a beautiful liquid smooth OS that Android can never compete. I have purchases this iPhone XR on New Year 2020 eve....and i can say that this is just awesome phone with great display and more important very gd battery performance....i just love this iPhone and want to recommend all those who are just thinking to buy new phone then this is for you..... Itís been 2 months I have purchased the XR, everything seems to be fine I.e, bigger in size, good battery life and advanced processor. †I love iPhone 1. When i started new product it asked for setup of apple id and in the process, product was heating 20+ degree and suddenly restarted half the way. Camera picture is yellowish. First thing that strikes you is the colour. Vibrant and really nice I have bought iphone xr through amazon sound quality is wrost speaker is pathetic when i approached them to return they clearlly denied....very bad exeperience. Defiantly iPhones are costlier than other brands, nowadays other brands like one plus are also selling phones at 50 k but the quality between iPhone and others are at no comparison Camera is awesome ... both for selfie as well other photography .. and fast interface .. only minus point is battery life time ..But yeah rest all features are good which makes this phone special !! Loved using it. PRODUCT RECEIVED IN GOOD CONDITION BUT FACE RECOGNITION FEATURE AND BACK CAMERA IS NOT WORKING WELL.THE I PHONE SUBMITTED TO I PHONE SERVICE CENTER LAST WEEK FOR REPAIR. Got it in 38k at the sale. The best iPhone till date. Itís a fantastic iphone. Perfect size, display is good, battery life is incredible. Camera results are excellent and comparable to xs and xs max. Super fast bionic A12 on board handles everything superbly. Ohh...what can I say about this phone... just one word- AWESOME. I think itís better than iPhone 11 in almost every aspect. The portrait mode is outstanding. If anyone is using iPhone 6,7 or 8, then this is next iPhone for you... face recognition is very fast iOS to Android (one plus and must admit, the phone is amazing and Iím still amazing), but back to iOS and do not regret. There are soo many little things that does make the difference and leaves the user with WOW feeling! XR is a bit thick but with time we get used to it. There was a hardware failure just in less than one month of purchase.  Amazon takes no responsibility of replacing it and I am working with iCare to fix it. It may even cost me to get it fixed. I was extremely unhappy with this phone and the post sale service. Just unboxed and found defect in screen. On informing Amazon, I was first assured for replacement and then amazon changed stand and asked me to contact apple care for examining mobile and creating inspection sheet even though problem is clearly visible and accepted by amazon as well. the phone is bogus nd it gets heated ,sometimes charger does nt work.camera is average,plz dont buy from amazon Worth of upgrading- One of the best camera in this price range, mind-blowing photo and video quality plus not to mention the best ever battery life on any Apple device I\\'ve used so far. Disappointed that it doesn\\'t come with finger print scanner just face unlock. Otherwise it\\'s a good apple phone if u r tight on budget Battery life is good Bought two phones on this sale. One is this awesome iPhone XR and another Samsung phone. iPhone is so awesome that I am in love with its touch, display , camera and sound quality and everything. Its very costly but I love this. Whilst others phone that I purchased was a big mistake. Was a little doubtful while purchasing since i was not sure to receive a genuine Apple iPhone but received absolutely a genuine one. Working perfectly till date. The only thing I donít like about this iPhone is that it takes a lot of time for charging. But its okay, itís manageable. Itís Apple and behaves like one! Itís slightly on a heavier side and a bit too big considering itís 6.1 inches. I have moved from 5S to XR -and it is a mind blowing experience. Battery life is okay camera is awesome everything After Apple reduced its price, iPhone XR did become affordable when considering its features. What I received was how it was described on Amazon. Reviewing after one month of use. Good battery life, amazing sound quality and camera is very good. Really love my first apple product. They have no fingerprints but face unlock is not compare to other its awesome battery is very very good and camera is best and iPhone is the iPhone not compare to other brand and most best thing is it is duel sim wow.......only not giving fast charging adaptor supported but u have to pay extra I was first hesitant about buying iphone xr after all the negative review....it has been 10 days and it is really a wonderful product.i got this deal for 38999 from amazon. Not charging fast as intended and battery discharges too quick. Needs replacement. Quick guide please. Phone stuck in between use of apps. Contact @8249530210/7873655744 The phone freezes frequently. Battery doesnít last long. On the whole I am very disappointed with the  phone. Did not expect this from Apple. Excellent Model with extraordinary deal during the festival season. I love Apple products and this is no difference. Quality of Photos is awesome. Battery life is better but i still feel can be improved. However for my usage it is ok. I shifted from android to this iphone , it really worth with all new amazing and premium experience . The battery life is far better than my expectations from iphones . I got this phone for 43k and I feel itís absolute value for money. Excellent sound quality...& thatís no one device is beat in this quality,Immersive display & awesome  performance .. I find display issue with my iPhone after a month now. I see thin black line from top to bottom just an inch from left side. Battery adapter is also not working properly. I am also unable to access amazon customer care also Great battery lifeís buttery smooth transitions/animations so so refined compared to an Android phone .Face recognition is a bit glitchy though my daughter can trigger it for my wifeís login I dont know how to explain it, but no need for any review... Just one word.. Apple... Go for it... Its worth your money.. The product is a masterpiece but the box corner was damaged like the box was undergone ruff conditions This is my second purchase of I phone through amazon I am happy and satisfied with the product....thanks to amazon ...keep it up The most unique feature of this product - face id for unlock is not working in the product delivered to me. Now i have to keep visiting the apple service centre to get it fixed. I have got the delivery of iphone xr yesterday and I have found that there is a spot near the front camera. Can anyone or the apple customer service tell me why it is like that? Iím an Apple fan, because of its simplicity, elegance & good camera. In addition, this phone has a longer battery life, even with good internet use. May be the price could be little more competitive, but all in all, a nice phone. Excellence phone. Every thing this fine. iPhone XR camera is better than OnePlus 7T...XR beat OP 7T... Excellent Phone... I like the phone very much. A great product from Apple.  Very happy that i bought this product in a discount. Worth every penny. The  photo quality is amazing.  The re-charging time is so less. Marvelous phone came with the proper packagee and proper secure coding from Amazon. Thank you Amazon for such an organised delivery I received the product with hair line scratch on the screen which does not appear at a glance but upon reflection of light on a specific angle it appears.  During delivery I could not detect it but after few days I recognized. From Apple I do not expect any cheating on product quality iPhone is always master in mobiles. Itís really amazing. Thanks amazon for best discounted price Day one is good with XR. Will have to use for some more days before conclusions. Battery life is impressive. Feels good to handle. Seems to slip out of hard sometimes. Face ID is not good..works sometime..sometime forces to use passcode to unlock..default keyboard layout does not have dot key..while editing text it is hard to place the cursor at a desired place in between a word..hey Apple get some update about these in if next update.. Amazing product as can be expected from Apple. Super camera. Super battery life. Super display. Amazing iphone XR experience ..you dont need iphone X or iphone Xs or iphone11pro the perfect iphone for any one who loves Apple brand ...go for iphone Xr or iphone11 both are just fabulous Amazing piece of art and technology from apple. Buy this beast especially if u r getting it below 40K. As far as the delivery experience is concerned it was not good and smooth at all due to delays and poor packaging from Amazon. Thumbs up for XR only not Amazon delivery experience. Amazing phone, the xs and xs max are way better but the price of this phone is the real winner. I got the fast charger and some new BT earphones woth the difference. Overall being my 1st iphone, it is really amazing My 4th I phone Just received the product! Feeling excited! Detailed review will be coming after a month. Delivery was awesome placed the order by yesterday evening received at today noon! The package was damage free . Letís see the future performance The overall look and usage is good but the time it takes to charge is nearly 3 hrs from nill to full.Considering to backside design its little coddy when compared to x .Definitely but u feel very much premium when using this the white is astonishing like sny thing worth for money. Looks good and also working great. The disappointed thing is while I was purchasing there is a screen replacement warranty but now it is not there. My first iphone..there are some problems switching the os but Iím so far happy with this change.though battery life is just okay with a mediocre and cheap charger. This a big daddy for all other branded phones ...I upgraded from 6s to this model..really a good decision i think .but one thing itís looks very big in hand ..you have to spent some time with that. Best iphone in this price range 1 month review. : Best deal from amazon under 55k for 128 GB , Excellent battery life almost used upto 2.5 Days with 4G Data enabled ,No face lock issues , Camera Quality is good but portrait feature works only with human face detection ,Red colour is very attractive its for my wife . shez coming from iphone 6s to this one . so its a upgrade for her . all in all a great phone . The phone I received is not starting at all and I canít see the option to replace, this is cheaty Nice phone in a great price deal... Best budget iphone currently. Got it for 40k(128 gb model) in amazon sale. Great phone from the greatest minds This is a very good product.You should buy it without any hesitation.Go for it.Battery of this Iphone XR is very good.It lasts upto 12-13 hours with light use.Face recognition is also excellent.This phone is very smooth to use and you will definitely love using it. good because phone is just awesome. Battery backup n camera is also good. But the phone is not slim like 6S or X/XS. A very good phone. Camera & facial recognition is just next level. Njoying it throughout! Best ever apple phone for value for money. Nothing to say. Amazing discount by amazon and delivery is also before time. Satisfied. Proximity sensor not working. Not able to make calls as all apps keep openig wbile making a call Like: Display, Sound, Battery Yesterday i got these Xr after a week at 52k best offer the best thing about Xr is battery life is good compare to other iPhones Xr is powerhouse games like pubg we can play in HD smoothly no heat no lag good camera not best iím satisfied no issues genuine product from amazon What a great phone!! Battery life is amazing, navigation is as usual the iPhone mark... overall an excellent experience. Apple is one of the addictions which never go once you use I use 7 and now xr to my sister absolutely beautifully crafted device and excellent camera phone.?? Loving this phone. Everything about this phone like speed, performance, camera, its amazing. Best for rs. 46200 Very good performance. And very good cameras .. water resistant and wireless charging makes this phone complete The quality of apple is fab u canít match with any Android smartphone...tried several smartphone but nun has given me this kind of superb experience.. The only 1 issue I actually faced is the mic is in very wrong place if i am driving it is very critical to answer inside the helmet as the mic is in back side of the phone. Rest all the awesome Itís been two weeks using the phone and I donít regret buying this... too good camera quality and battery back up... good enough storage... loved it!!! Everything is good so far! pH is dead, not responding. Defective product. And no option to return. Excellent phone with an excellent camera & fantastic battery life; dual sim (second one is e-sim) option is quite practical. Camera quality is excellent with portrait mode. iOS is as usual superb & user friendly with excellent performance. We don\\'t see much update on this version however we see that phone is as always amazing with the performance. Everything is excellent ... if u want to buy then surely go for it.. (in short paisa vasul kaam) First time apple user... but to be honest... apple is amazing from the all aspects.. camera, sound , battery , display , lagging issues everything is far better than android mobile....itís 12 mp camera looks like 48 mp of an android mbl...! Quality differs from others !!!! Iphone is the best. Prompt delivery from Amazon. Two camera could have been even better Good product, great experience! When I switched on it started getting heated up near camera.  Mix of gold and yellow is bit ugly. My other side of speaker isnít working. Selfie portrait is good rest is not much appreciable. Superb it is. It does not require any review. Large screen, superb quality, 128 GB memory and what else you want iPhone XR is the current rightly priced phone from Apple. It is a good product . This phone does not have fingerprint unlock security, only face recognition is present. Perfect phone for Apple lovers, camera and built quality of this phone is amazing. Itís around 6 months when I purchased this phone, everything works like a charm, there are lot of hidden features that I still donít know about this phone. Reason for 4 star as the earphone given as part of this purchase are not up to the mark and when I take call using earphone people complaint about sound is not proper and sound come good when I remove the earphone while talking on phone. I had bad experience from Amazon within 2 days my phone having charging issue and I didn\\'t get any response from Amazon. I have upgraded from iPhone 7. Face recognition excellent, Camera Good with portrait photography. Battery life... Very good. Bit heavier, but comfortable! Amazon did the delivery a little bit late. But the phone is awsome. Very nice phone, very fluid interface, face recognition is really very good but I think Apple should bring back the fingerprint scanner and that Apple specific home button. I got this during festival sale at Rs 45000 and I am really enjoying this phone. Performance, camera, sound, display everything is top standard and no smartphone can match this at this price. Love this ???? Phone is not working properly and they are not replacing my product and the product was in replacement warranty.  Please do not buy from Amazon because if there will be any problem under 10 days they will not replace the phone. They will just give the customer care no. Lot of software issues in it. Specially your contact names will not displayed on screen when you receive the call from one of your stored contact person. Raised the issue multiple times but very poor performance from Apple. Don\\'t buy this model. People spoke have criticised about the iPhone XR\\'s screen, compared to xs I found this screen is more colour accurate, My new XR PHONE  is GETTING HUNG frequently When I shuffle around the apps. I donít have much apps active though I moved apps from my iCloud. Even few apps get struck and couldnot do any actions. I havenít seen in my 6S though the issue. Using it since 15 days and till now could not find anything disappointing with this phone. Battery running for about 2 days!, Camera is single lens but clicks very good, Speed and screen all is perfect. Upgraded myself from Iphone 6s. Awesome experience with IPhone XR red Color There are some problems with the iPhone xr I bought 15 days ago. Most affordable iphone really proves when it comes to photography, performance and off-course Battery backup. Having been with it for almost 2 months it has clicked most of the boxes urban smartphone should offer. Only complaint that face reader is not as great as fingerprint reader in older version of iphone. iPhone XR simple superb. Awesome phone, good battery life, awesome camera... 4k recording and i have started vlogging channel in YouTube with xr only,,, shooting, editing and uploading all in one.. awesome performance. What I really admire about this piece is 2 things: The product I received is value for money. Battery life is pretty much cool. Loved the system performance. Worth buying. I ordered the phone on August 8 2019 and it was delivered to me on August 14 2019 and itís been 7 months and now my phone is fully dead and is not working at all. I have only used the phone for couple of days now, but it looks really good. Amazon did a good job in timely delivery. Probably the phone is very good so far, and I am in no position to give a proper feedback unless have used it for a while. Best if u donít want to see annoying ads in ur feed Great product, a good upgrade from iPhone 6s, large screen, fast, water resistant, great camera, and looks good too Original Product ??, still remember while opening the packet please make a short video of what you received. Superb phone. Wish they could match the battery life with what other manufacturers are offering at one third the price Apple may release the dual sim slots for India. It may increase the sale and customer also i think. Defective piece This is awesome product as usual. Didnít regret but buy this. Must go for it. Only thing, this is a bit bigger phone for single hand user. Great phone with good fingerprint reader, camera quality and long lasting battery life ! As always grt Nice product, looks good Awesome mobile.. Very bad experience with the iPhone XR Battery life is good but the problem is with the phone heating very quickly. Even redmi\\'s who are known for getting heated quickly, get less heated as compared to iPhone Xr. I steal one star for it. iPhone XR is really one of the best Apple Products Iíve ever used! Iíve had used iPhones in the past but nothing matches XRís feel and optimisation. Not only does it look good, but also performs superbly well. Much recommended. The features of the phone are very good. Camera and the operating system. Anyone here to compare this with android. Please keep in my, comparison happens between apple to apple and not apple with oranges. 1. I have purchased iPhone XR 64 GB .All are features seems good as per expectation but I got newt work issue in this phone . Hanging issue, network dropping issue needed restart to get network again. Face detection is also very disappointed, please never waste your money with this product. Nice phone in all respect. Just go for it, try buying the 128GB or 256GB model if you are planning to record your game clips ... because 30mins of screen recording costs 4GB memory .... Best phone for the best price. Purchased at prime sale for 40k. Best iPhone ever for this budget. Worth the money, performance is good even with 3gb memory.  Apps are pretty fast. Itís a good phone obviously, It doesnít have any defects, delivery was smooth and non-problematic, phone works great, best camera ever, overall, Iím happy with my purchase The Iphone has been stuck on set up page after i tried restoring it. I heard many people fear to use Apple phones as its os is slightly difficult to use. But I feel that once we are familiar with it then it is very easy to use compared with android phones. The build quality is superb. Also the camera is fantastic. Good phone. I been an iphone user for the design simplicity. This is a good phone. One does not need a pro version. This is a champ Have bought this iPhone after iPhones 6.im pretty happy with the device,battery is too good,camera is great,Performance is swift no lags till now played hefty games like pubg  and asphalt 8 on this phone no lags were found at all.overall an excellent device I bought this phone last week and in one week charger started misbehaving. Sometimes charger got disconnected and sometimes phone is not getting charged . I purchased it from Appario pvt ltd. And they sent me a genuine, brand new iPhone XR so 5 stars. Best budget phone by apple,cant believe the overall performance and the tremendous display quality, who says the display is not good, obviously its not good itís excellent. And thanks to Amazon for providing me the phone within 12hrs. I already have Google Pixel 2XL. I can proudly say that iphone XR can not match the camera quality of Pixel. good so far it s been a week battery is good .... not fond of clicking pics so cant say but clicked few theay are good Great device. Battery easily last for a day. Amazing Camera. Got it for 40k and at this price there can\\'t be any better device. I upgraded from iPhone 5s to iPhone XR and Iím not regretting at all. Battery capacity, camera, speed, everything seems perfect for me. Your budget is not enough to buy iPhone 11, max or max pro then definitely you can go for this. You will not regret it. Really great product by apple just love the beast inside this machine... charging is quite good. And mostly pubg is super smooth and everything is great really a beast by apple One month of usage and the phone is dead ! Tried all solutions suggested by apple but no signs of recovery. Next option is to take it to service center. iPhone XR one of the best mobile and os Finger print reading and camera quality is good. Apple is the best. iPhone XR 64gb is best buy even in 2019. I bought it during festive sale at 37,999/- †I am happy to buy this amazing phone from Amazonís thanks .... itís original phone ....love this camera .each and every thing in box charger headphones manuals books...seal box Recived. Best in the Class... Awesome battery life, magnificent design, camera quality 10/10, fully satisfied, worth of every penny. Buy it with blind eyes. If you want a new phone, just go for the Xr because itís price is pretty reasonable and also it has a very good battery life. I am very happy with it Speaker not working one side when I get calls sound very lowwww Value for money phone . bought at 39999. perfect . absolutely perfect . Good one, very nice product, no complaints till date camera is good, super battery life loved the product, red colour is awesome It\\'s a genuine product, verified on apple\\'s website. Everything is working as expected Everything was just perfect. Within a week the ringer volume varies and the  WiFi signal is very weak when compared to other iphones. Camara quality is good , Face ID works well. Everything good you expect of an iPhone Super phone ... great product and thanks to amazon for the great price Man the battery life increment from iPhone 7 was mind blowing.. screen is not a problem unless u have used a 1080p oled screen. Perfect phone at perfect price. Most liked Apple phone with dual sim. Amazon price of this phone is lowest. 43000 Rs. Best phone with best display battery camera is excellent everything is best Total fraud gone with me , initially face sacnner was good but now a days after one month itís not working properly n problem of going phone hang is obvious n regular, total disappointed from this phone n if this happens further i m gonna sue them @AmazonIndia It has almost been three months since I bought this phone and am now facing a problem with its left audio speaker which has completely stopped working. Only the right audio speaker is functioning.  Kindly assist. A hair line crack which could only be detected by the shop keeper who was applying the screen guard . A very fine crack which was missed Product arrived good,got it at Rs 38000 at amazon sale.Thanks Amazon Good phone.  Not aware it has finger print reader Apple iPhone xR, I think this product donít need any recommendations, only my review for amazon sale. I bought this at never before price 37999/- Only cons are overall little bezel around the screen as compare to XS version. Battery lasts for a day on normal use including music, chatting and social media use. Good delivery from amazon This is an awesome product by Apple. Awesome product, Worth buying if in budget One of the best iphone I have ever used.  battery life very good.Camera quality has no match when it comes to shooting videos from XR. Amazon service is good. Best phone so far. Battery backup is unexpectedly huge Speaker of this phone is cracked while I received this product Nice camera and superb battery life compared to previous models of iPhone. Very happy with my iPhone XR red. Awesome phone and apple tag it self looks so premium in hands and face lock works superb overall happy to buy this phone instead of one plus 7 Got the phone for Rs 53,250 in the prime day sale. Used it for 5 days and itís the usual apple experience. Good picture, touch and camera quality is excellent considering it has a single camera. Itís a bargain at this price bracket. So lets face the truth, everyone thought that its a flop iphone from apple. But it turn out to be great. The LCD screen everyone was talking about is not that bad, you wonít even find any difference. It is little on heavy and bulky side coming out of apple but given the price range itís a good buy As apple kept the price it is worth it for a first time Apple user but for old apple users the xr is not that great Apple it has thick bezzel and its quite heavy too what its good at it is the colour options and camera quality and the chip it provides. Charging pin problem Very happy with performance especially sound and picture quality †bad product Camera unable to use any external links in this article but it should be mentioned in this discussion on the web very disappointing. I received an old phone. It already had pictures clicked. I love it Battery issue is problem discharge very fast and take time to charge almost 03 hrs. Dude,, this phone is a beast..u will love this phone My first iPhone. Awesome phone. Rich User experience, speed, battery, camera, looks excellent. Smooth, fast (no lags). Good build quality, best lcd display ( not to compare with sAmoled screen) 5out of 5. Must buy. Amazons quality product. This phone is kind of the best iPhone in terms of value of money. The only thing you will miss is the oled display which is on the expensive iPhones but only when you compare them side by side. Got the 128gb @50k so pretty good. It\\'s awesome iPhone. Loaded with a pack of features. Face ID and Memoji is super, Thanks Amazon and Also to Apple. Facetime didn\\'t work.Air Drop fails too. camera quality is as like my earlier IPHONE 6. Battery performance is excellent. I have moved from iPhone 6 to XR Quiet good but little bit of scratches only on outer cover. An improved product by Apple, appreciative. Powerful battery and camera is supremely good, suggest you to have another wireless charger, rather than fabulous product. loved it. i live with it. very durable battery. good picture quality. Best Budget iphone. Got The right buy at the right price. The battery is holds up well. Rest is as described by lot of reviewers, it\\'s an easy to use and maintain iPhone. Apt pricing. Good for designers & developers who need a test device. Fasted delivery Camera is good , First of all apple product is genuine product no lacking , but however battery charging is too low compared with new edition with android phone vocc charge and dash charge at least apple should have fast charging Technelogies Video not working. Out voice we can\\'t hear. Amazon is giving worst products to customers. I am going to file a case with the proofs It has been a week since I started using it and as of now thoroughly enjoying it. awsm camera n good performance This is my first iPhone. Great experience. Bought @43k price in sale in 22 January 2020. Great design ??. From photos I thought that there will be airpods with it but actually it\\'s earphone ??. But phone is awesome.Best phone for 2020. U said it is a water resistant product but when I was answering my calls the front speaker was not working properly and I could not hear the speaker. This was my main issue and other was that constantly my phone was lagging in between. Everthing about this phone is good except the back glass which is not durable.the backglass shattered into  pieces from simple fall in the car and apple asking to phone for whopping 53000 to change thephone my phone is just 20 days old A beast , thank u Amazon for quick delivery,  definitely a worth it phone apple has manufactured  . Always a Apple lover .. Very happy with my decision! This phone is amazing and the blue colour is very cute and unique being an iPhone. The battery life is better then the other iPhones that I have used and you will fall in love with the camera!! Moved fro iPhone 5s and xr is simply superb. Good mobile , but bezels screwed me , battery life is decent , please skip this and buy iPhone X , a waaaay better than any other devices , it is nice , compact , premium feel, Xr doesnít gave me such a good feel iPhone doesn\\'t need any reviews.its always best and better that iPhone X If you have a budget of 45k you should definitely go for iPhone Xr it has super powerful chipset and no matter what you do you cannot use it to it\\'s full potential it is buttery smooth and super reliable with great battery life Mobile of d year... truly fast... great camera.... good price 38k thanks to amazon... Touch Screen response slow.dificult to close running apps. Sound not working, buy from another seller Itís a higher end mobile so the screen guard should be provided with this packing it can work to make customer Happy. There was a line in the display. Does not support dual physical sim . Screen size is smaller. Does not allow google . All downloads are paid downloads.  All songs storage is through I tunes application which also comes at a cost. Lot of drawbacks for a normal user and not user friendly. Leaving all other iPhone advantages over android i mention the pros and cons of this device. Phone hanging issue observed. Application closing swipe up action hangs the screen and does not allow to close the application. After restart phone works well. This is intermittent. A good phone especially for camera quality. And lives upto all I phone users expectations. Although not very user friendly for non iOS or android users. The colours it comes in are genuinely awesome. Earlier i was having Apple Product which i bought it from Dubai, and now i am using XR which i bought it online, and this really sucks. The earphone quality is not the one apple used to have, Zero Noise Cancellation, zero Quality. Mobile has some defect. Gets struck some time. Awestrucked with this I phone.. one of the best i phone i have used.. i have 4S, 6S and 7. I experienced trouble while using the phone for calls. I could not hear most of the time or the receiver could not hear. call fails in between abruptly.  This is very annoying phone. I wish I had returned it. Itís an awesome phone with some great inbuilt features...donít worry about the display it wonít disappoint you at all Don\\'t think much if ur dual sim lover than go with iPhone xr †This mobile is gud but fast charging is not available it will take 5 to 6 hours to charge fully I have a doubt it is an old one Amazing received original I phone XR , rear camera performance is God leval when front camera quality is not good Good looking phone at g8 price 37999 it fulfills more than my expectations an ofcourse the brand is enough to justify the value of product Good one every thing is superb I love this phon very much and now m going to buy laptop also please do quite low price macbook because I have to buy please do some less price macbook because I have to buy after luckdoun please please You will never get service for this brand. iPhone service center not taking there product. Good battery.packing is very poor.iphone cover is good.so my phone is not damaged. I have been using this phone for the last 4 months and itís working fine, And the best part about this phone is its battery. Now the price of this phone has decreased alot one can definitely buy this phone Nothing great about the phone, would prefer oneplus 7 pro version. Every feature is quite impressive but the camera quality should be slight higher its not up to the mark as shown in advertisement.. My phone stop working after 3 days...I hv to rush to apple store ...thank god I got my ph replace..I really got worried as it was new phone ..but won\\'t purchase phone again online will purchase directly from store.. As usual, Apple product when compared to other mobile phones in similar category are priced higher .. but I like the improvements in battery when compared with previous iPhones Good product. Loved by my husband as a birthday gift . I didn\\'t get a warranty paper in any form along with this product. The product seems to be in perfect condition though. Its very bulky and photo quality is not good. Great look coral colour One of the best purchase from Amazon. Packing and Delivery is good uncomparable. The phone and it\\'s performance are satisfying. 12 days usage of the phone left me without a complaint. I give 5 ?? to this purchase. Iím mad about I phone forever and ever no words to define This iphone is my second iphone followed by iphone 5s and battery of this phone great which provide at leat 1.5 days backup. iPhone xr is great phone Just go for it. Everything was known. If your budget permit go for it. All apple product..only budget is issue. Display quality is fantastic, face recognition has some lag issues Awesome phone got it at a Very good price during the Prime Sales The weight of phone is too heavy... Although the video recording is awesome the Photos quality simply doesn\\'t justify it\\'s price... Just the best smartphone in this segment. Absolutely love it. The quality, the software, the camera, the face id, the battery and everything. FaceID & handsfree is not up-to the mark. Battery is draining like anything please help. Is it a genuine product. Amazon please help as i heard the batter suppoy is good but in this product batter is worst. it\\'s iPhone !!! What else???? Ringer voice is very slow what is the issue I donít think any phone comparable in this range. The phone is amazing but i got cheated as i was promised the EMI of 4040 per month for 12 months. The sum of rs 4275 got deducted from my account. This is seriously not fare as i m paying almost 1500 rs more for my phone. Awesome phone. Very good battery backup. Fingerprint scanner not available. Lightening fast Face ID. Call quality is awesome. While transferring data from android to iOS, WhatsApp chat data wonít be transferred. Got it at 43k during sale, and you can get it for 45k during normal days. This price cut is because it is being assembled in India. It is a great value for your money at that price. †Best iPhone xr but it\\'s a bit weight and good performance but heating.. bought it for 38k I upgraded from iphone 5 to Xr, and there is a huge difference in battery. According to my mobile usage, I used to charge iPhone 5 thrice a day and Now, I charge my Xr once in 3 days. The difference is immense. Got at ?36,999.00/- on 28.09.2019 The phone is good, the only problem that I\\'m facing is that the phone keeps freezing for few minutes since the new iPhones have launched. Service is very good by Amazon. 5 star Good quality as the name says ìAppleî. But price dropped down after my purchase. I wish to buy IPhone 11 good phone This seller is not reliable, the brand new sealed phone did not work and had to be in the service center for a week. Do not recommend Appiaparo. Also, this was not the first time that there product was faulty Every 1 knows wats the quality of Apple is, no reviews are required. Best of Apple make till know. I really like the phone its awesome i upgraded my 6s to Xr i am really happy with the performance Whenever we try to call any person, the opposite person cannot hear anything. We went to apptronic service centre , which was of no use. We have paid rs.42000/- for Iphone XR but not able to use it. We need replacement The product is amazing with its features. The battery performance is  remarkable.The response for the Face ID is also Awesome.The only Con is that itís Slightly heavy.the overall price has also gone down considerably. Battery life has a problem, also gets hang sometimes. Product was good, but got a defect in camera lens. Even though i got camera replaced from a planet care store, but still i never expected this from an apple product. This was my first apple product & probably my last. Appearance  is Very Good Amazing phone which has almost all the features of iphone Xs. Amazing camera and battery life Awesome product...nothing can beat iPhone...excellent Nd full security... Great product. Battery easily lasts more than a day and very good camera. Iphone XR is one of the best phone. Camera Quality is awesome . Got this Phone  at approx 40K. Itís worst mobile, this is not value of money, iOS is not friendly user,worst battery life, oneplus is better than iPhone Display quality is not as per standered  as apple , when i use this fone  , i could have feel stress in my eyes  . Using this for more than 2 months. The phone is awesome. Camera quality is really good. This phone is the strongest iPhone. It has the best battery. It lasts for one day in normal usage. An amazing phone by apple for an affordable price I am not satisfied. Screen touch for select any app is very poor & Iphone xr stopped working automaticallyq without any reason and is not working fine.My suggestion is not to buy from here This is the most worth iPhone now ! It finest have 3D Touch but it is amazing ! And camera is just wow and always the same iOS smoothness Superb performance A great leap for me from 5s to XR. I am enjoying this smashing experience. Loving each and every bit of this marvel. Speaker stopped working within 4 days of use !!! Everything is good but the battery dies too fast. Maybe they meant to say lowest battery life in their ad but mistakenly wrote highest. Anyway the software is no doubt amazing. First time coming to iOS from Android, always used to hear why people praise so much to the iOS. It definitely meet the expectations, so far so good. Smooth UI, Nice Camera and crazy battery performance. Thanks Amazon. :) Apple announced one year free subscription of Apple TV plus when an apple product is purchased. How can I get this ? Camera is really pathetic. Just usual mobiles costing less than 10000 are far better in taking pictures. Phone is amazing,  amazon delivery is not notch,  received it next day.  Overall amazing phone It\\'s iPhone... I feel better than 11 I feel. The phone is good so far.... initially had trouble with the ear piece while calling, it\\'s working fine now after removal of its plastic cover... phone is classy. Features are great, feels premium in hand .. Nothing can be luxurious than this at the time when you hold the piece you will feel like out of the crowd and join elite legacy speaker is not working properly, and getting extra noise while listening to the voice from other side. †Such a worst product , don\\'t buy , all time hang, I\\'m despointed to iPhone xr Love the phone. I wasnít sure about the size of the phone. But once I started using it I think the size is perfect. It was a bit heavier than expected but the built is amazing. Overall is a terrific buy. Wonderful, Classic One ! I used to be fan of I phone 3Gs mobile, I am getting same Feelings with this mobile, camera quality much much better compare to any otgers, U want to buy it, just grab it, Good but I think iphone se camera is far better.overall good device.battery backup is awesome Itís a Face ID in this phone and not fingerprint, best deal and there is no need to add dedicated review as itís a apple phone :) as usual never disappointed with apple phone Perfect product in the price range of 40k. It includes good camera, wonderful operating system, nice touch screen and product design. Only problem you may face is with battery backup. Got it for best price! iPhone is love. <3 <3 The charger provided with this product Stops working suddenly and itís only been 4 days that I received the product kindly get a replacement for the charger Really awesome device. Have been using for about 2-3 months... secure, fast, and really user engaging. Yes, price is always a issue with apple devices but their devices make every penny worth it... at least this one does?? Best buy This phone iPhone XR is the best value for money itís as hard as a metallic brick Feels solid elegant in your hand especially the red product I am totally happy with the device and would recommend it thanks Apple I was very happy with this phone. This battery had very long durability.Value for price. The quality of picture is very good it had 4K video up to 60fps . It is very good phone for those people who want an iPhone It is one of the affordable iPhones. Speed and quality is same as XS, a little difference with regards to 3D Touch and camera. Face id unlock is awesome, battery backup is best of all iphones. Touch is butter smooth. U have to go by IOS user interface not like android UI this is the only con. Best cam Obviously itís an awesome product I had this phone XR on deal 128gb n m happy now to have this AMAZON giving original Apple products thats what we want Got it during Festival sale with good discount from amazon India . Best iphone till date on every specs  with butter smooth ios and camera quality also looks good. Overall it\\'s a good performing iPhone . have ot for now 2 months and exceeds expectation If you are looking for an iPhone and your budget is around 50k-60k then you should definitely go with iPhone XR. It is the value for money iPhone. I\\'ve been using it for the past 3 days and I am really happy with its performance. Phone looks great, easy setup for existing Apple  users, camera is impressive with the additional modes. Overall totally satisfied with the purchase detailed review on battery after one month of use will follow. This is the best phone anyone can buy given the price range. Had a little trepidation before buying it from Amazon given the comments of Amazon not being an authorised seller, but this product is worth a go! Great phone Best Buy so far.. was sceptical about ordering online, fearing a faulty piece, but worth every penny. Good phone. Definitely worth the money. For me it was either one plus 7t or Iphone XR. Being an Iphone user for such a long time, i juat couldnít go for one plus. Turns out to be the better decision. Mobile is superfast same as amazons delivery speed. Camera is good, face unlock is fast and gets my face everytime Excellent phone, superb camera ,screen is extra large , processor is lightning fast What a powerful device delivery at time good packing. I am 15 year samsung user but apple is apple Very good phone i was android user but first tym using ios and only want to say go for it donít hesitate to shift from android to ios u will not be disappointed very good phone in apple series iPhone XR is a great phone on budget price, great camera but only lag is the battery life, that apple should work on. It is a outstanding phone... I really like thise I phone... Camera quality is good moar than One + mobile... Battery life is very good... performance is very good... Overall Nice phone ... Plz buy it and enjoy Itís a apple with great battery and user friendly, Very good Good product. Did not get any cash back even after buying through smart buy. Please resolve This is my 2nd Iphone (Previos one is Iphone 6) but this one is undoubtedly Perfect in all aspects whether it is face recognition or camera quality or batter life everything. Thatís what I call a Smart Phone. Face recognition is too good, front and rear camera quality is very cool, especially in night and yes battery life of iPhone XR is way too better than other iPhone series almost 7 to 8 straight hrs can be use Really like for display, battery life and operating comfortably. Got it in 50k during sale. Overall an Excellent phone.?? Awesome mobile brilliant quality performance good .thkq Amazon such beautiful mobile xr just go for it colour wise in India white,product red,,black and also yellow also awsome but Iam taken white colour . Phone gets hotter while charging and while watching video. Has it been repaired and sold? I got XR with a great deal in Amazon and surprising this is awesome variant from Apple. Face ID works awesome and battery life is too good Camera is awesome. A single 12 M.P rear camera beats other 60 M.P Androidís camera. It was very good, Face ID is much improved after updating to IOS13 version. Iím using this from 2-3 months now, with one sim itís giving good battery backup but if you are using esim(dual sim) do not compare with android dual sim phone battery backup. Camera is good. Feels little bulky. The headphones stopped working after a month or so. There is no wear and tear. Touch screen is not Upto the mark. Amazon did not provided the original bill of Apple Xr to me in soft copy at my email nor hard cooy to my house. Please provide the same at the earliest. Rest phone specifications lies between 2 to 3 star only. awsm phone bwalll red color is best color bhailog ankh bnd krke phone lelo and sirf amazon se best online site amazon phone best awsm look awsm profomance 100/100 stars go fo it After using the phone for a week found it to be a great product.

Great phone for the price. Performs really well compared to the higher end phones at the same segment .

Very good battery life and very nice photo quality. Dual SIM works smoothly. Excellent call quality and speaker sound is loud enough. Overall a very decent phone. No finger print .very pathetic. wen u use helmet u have to put password and password also not work fast type. Battery drain fast and charge late.

Best user experience till date. Received genuine product with one year free screen replacement. Loved it. itís been a week since i got this and itís been amazing I must say best iPhone device of apple. Colour (Red) is looking very premium. Camera quality is excellent even in low light condition. Longest battery backup from iPhone devices. Excellent product. If you are a fan of quality and durability, this is it. Amazing battery life and innovative integration with Mac and Watch. Awesome Iphone XR loved it My Order date was 19-May-2019, So i thin 1 Year Warranty is expiring in May-2020. I need to purchase extended warranty. Kindly assist. Battery is aswesome, and screen visibility/touch screen is too good. Replaced my iphone 6s and i am quite happy with this phone where i can use my entire day in 2 hrs charge only in early morning. Got a defect mobile and got it replaced. They simply publish that the product is replaceable within 10days but when we they tel us to get replacement key from apple. Such a faking morons It is such an premium phone. The build quality is great and UI is fast and fluid. If you want to have a iPhone with all latest features by sacrificing the display this is the one for you Good product camera quality superb, battery life good and face lock. I am happy to receive the item and thanks to amazon for deliver genuine product in very short time I had an issue with waterproofing of the phone as proper functioning of the ear speaker returned 2 days later after the incident. The best iPhone in affordable price with huge screen.......loved it to the core ???????????????????????????????? Battery life is amazing... this phone has changed my mind and thoughts towards iPhones. I have used every iPhone as of now however battery life is amazingly good in XR also camera is outstanding. I already knew the product was good, you donít invest without actually studying what youíre buying, the service by Amazon was great, I got next day deliver, best offer and a good quality product! I as using Xr since last two week, totally satisfied with the phone. Thank u Amazon for the original product, quick delivery and awesome deal. The entry level product to get into Apple house of quality product. excellent phone delivered by amazon in very good condition. Only hitch is apple should provide fast charging options (when even low range phones are supporting fast charging). I phone xr is also a good product, battery life is better than other i phones in market. Value for money. Face recognition is superb.. battery life is better than average.. camera is good..product is good happy to use What can I say, itís an apple. Every inch of it is pure bliss particularly the camera , superb battery life I delayed my decision which cost me 5000 because of price hike but still 7000 less than market price Loved everything about this product. brought it on sale at 35k and can not point out a single thing which is not as per expectation. Great battery life, lasts 2+ days with heavy usage. Voice quality even on Vodafone network was quite good, and that is saying a lot. I was not given ear pods even though it was mentioned in the description of the product, kindly send me the ear pods Budget iPhone with some miner issue, proximity sensor not works properly, if call is on and we move away phone from ear then it shows black screen, or not lightning up screen Received product well nd got good discount. Actually iam an android user for past 6 years but now i want to upgrade to i phone nd i choose xr so i decided to buy it in amazon really i feel so gud nd they are rally kind nd gentle to me tq These people promised me for cashback n now they took their step back ... they even have recordings of their promise ....worst site even phone also defective .... not working well after a month No flexibility in personalization of handset.. Not user friendly.. Their is a difference between sophisticated & complicated.. It tends to inclined towards latter.. They have not provided lightning connector but mentioned in the box providing lightning connector Do you really need any review here? Probably not. Camera,battery,face recognition are excellent Reasonable price in apple range n worth it Did not expect such poor camera quality from apple phones even my earlier iphone had a better camera. Overall has a good battery backup but really disappointed with camera quality... We can not add song and videos from the outer device. Some application is not supported like true caller, call records, google map not working properly, battery back up is very nice. Thank you, Amazon for delivering the order within two days. The phone is a real bomb. Just loving it. Best camera, long battery, everything is great. I\\'d highly recommend this phone. I\\'m in love with how this phone feels in the hand when held properly. Battery life is super good. Bad battery life and heats up Overall worth paying, value for money, durable, efficient, advance product Value for money no difference 11 or sr Packet received from amazon without any flaws. Night mode pictures were a disappointment, battery backup is superb, never ever had expected such a powerful catalyst. Overall it is a ìtake itî I bought it for a steal price. I definitely recommend to buy it when in sale As usual a good phone at this price point. Awesome Product.. very difficult to describe feelings in words.. but it is simply awesome.. Am speechless and just lovin it.. Extremely satisfied with this product. Turely value for money. Awesome phone. Bought @ prime day at 55k. Best deal Being an Apple fan for more than 20 years love this iPhone. If you have a budget of 45k + .. donít think of any other phone .. just buy XR .. loved it Got the blue iPhone XR 128 gb for 43000.. works like a charm. All day battery in heavy use and two day with normal use... camera is super awesome. Thanks Amazon. Touching screen is not quite good, sometime it hangs, when calling time screen get blank, then we have to press Power button 2 times then it wakes up... Fantastic product Good and value for money This phone is a beast, great battery life and the user experience on this phone is amazing as well Colour is totally different. Don\\'t go with the looks in Amazon website. Good perfomance. Got it at 42k Bad battery life Nice phone Nothing new to share about Apple. Itís a perfect mobile Finally an IPhone with excellent battery backup. Face recognition works perfectly and so does Siri. If you are unsure about Iphone 11, go for this one It\\'s a nice deal through Amazon.The product quality of iPhone XR is amazing.Such a grt experience to have an iPhone.This is first time I m using an apple product.You can go for it blindly Good product but single back camera Never purchase Apple products on Amazon. Worst product! Even worst service by Amazon! The phone was having heating issues! Very worst quality 100% satisfied with the quality  shipping genuine product all things are working fine product is 100% genuine shipping time as said very fast Nothing new to write about iPhone. The color of the phone is just gorgeous!!! Everyone loves it. Capable of good processing and memory optimization is fantastic which leads to lag free experience in high gaming application It is a great phone for professional usage Over all the performance is good. I am happy with this iPhone XR especially for all day lasting battery. Excellent mobile phone ,I love it Moved from android to iOS different experience. Good battery back up. Getting charge is too late compared to android mobiles. Fast charger is not available with box. Camera was awesome Just owsm.. battery backup supb, camera quality supb, class look Exactly after 15 days my lightning cable discharges some greenish liquid and stopped working , and when shown to apple service care center they told it willbe not covered under warranty. This liquid retina high quality display doesn\\'t beat my Samsung A8. Very disappointed. Sold in 2day. The name itself says a lot about the product I switched from Android to this one and it is worth the switch. I got it for 50k which is the lowest deal ever. Overall build quality is good Great purchase from Amazon and product even better as expected, you canít compare with other brands apple is apple... its good product but not tested for esim I like this phone, great battery back up..and after all its iphone. Happy with it Face recognition Nd battery life is not too good as I was thinking..the face unlock is automatically open by my bro face as he is not put his face as password in the phone then also how When the call come together it hang and light of to use again we put side up down button 2 times Better than iPhone X, but price is still high compare to OnePlus market Awesome price and awesome product by Apple and sold by amazon. Best product this time.  Don\\'t go for x or 11. Go for it then wait 02 yrs.for new one. Very good phone..takes very long time to charge almost 1.30 hr I got a iPhone day was only working for 3 hours post which it never got started..lot of effort done but not single customer service could let me know what\\'s the way out. Screw you guys Every thing according to my desire. Battery is comparatively good according to my desire. Camera quality so majestic and with high quality and resolution. Eternally better than android Nice camera Amazing battery approx 24 hour e sim dual sim functionality very good I love it superfast delivery by Amazon thank you Amazon and Apple After iphone 6s i purchase XR model..which is highly smooth in usage.. I don\\'t seem to have got cash back of RS. 3000. Can you please check. overall satisfied with the new iPhone XR NYC The product is good for those who are in view of buying ios having a full display as per the recent trend. Sometimes itís automatically switched off while it have enough battery life. Ringtone sound and other output sounds are not rangable one and its like low level mobile. Its best budget iphone to buy in market right now. Display is not a serious issue and remaining features are similar to its siblings xs and xs max. Bought it for ?52k so got a excellent deal. over all mobile is good but after one month using this phone now my battery Maximum Capacity showing 98% which is not acceptable. if u want to secure phone then go for ios. Product is damn good on all counts. A fast charger required. WhatsApp data transfer  from earlier Android device is not possible. All the features were cool except the green dot that appears on most of the photos in the form of a lens flare is a bit annoying. Buy it without hesitation,awesome camera, awesome battery life , everything is good. Nothing to say about it I am very disappointed with Amazon within 3 months of buying an iphone the phone got dead and is not switching on. I wouldn\\'t recommend anyone to buy an iphone from amazon. After long time apple have launched budget phone which is very good. Itís awesome. Itís my first Iphone and I love it so much. Battery life is too good. Genuine product received not fault in package no product damage. Wonderful device. Go for it, value for money. Bought during Sales. Ppl who wants to enjoy great experience of iOS at budget, then go for this. I am sure you will not regret. Great buy, i was using android for years never used iPhone. But after purchasing Xr i can clearly see the difference, iPhone is far more faster and nice interface Super smooth and easy to use with full 1.5 day battery life with dual SIM and moderate usage of phone... Superb phone at 45k ... Apple at its best ... Awesome processing ... I purchased this iPhone XR I think the same is refurbished item which I received. Excellent Product Excellent phone with wireless charging. Best mobile in low price, camera quality is batter then from China mobile 48 mega pixel means 12=48 ?? Face unlocked very fast, Please provide original invoice as the copy provided with phone was incomplete and torn . I have submit the same in my office. Please do the needful on priority. Nice 1 performance,camera,battery and all features all awesome Amazing product. Got in lightening deal Awesome phone Defenetly worth it No one can beat Apple Processors. Best phone I\\'ve ever had The phone is not good as normal I phones . Always hang. Face recognition always give problems . And if you go service Center they say take backups and come back Got a good deal in the sale, worth it The most complete IPhone ever. You will not miss the fingerprint reader, the Face ID is amazingly fast. I am also getting good battery life with it. The single is doing wonderfully well. Genuine product in best price, Happy to upgrade with iPhone XR :) Awesome phone! True genius and different from others.. Amazing buy. Works perfectly fine and I bought it at an unbelievable offer price. super mobile Superb and satisfied with performence, face recognition is little bit slow rest all is gud... Awesome. Bang for buck. Has the features you are willing to pay for , a very decent price post HDFC cash back offer. It\\'s an awesome product from Apple, The battery life has improved alot than the previously launched iPhone models. User interface and iOS 13.2 is excellent. Guys just go for it... Excellent performance and swift touch Except it gets a little heated in the back while playing , other than that itís the best. The mobile phone is too heavy and there is no fingerprint sensor (though there is Face ID). Otherwise everything else is great. Thanks Amazon for this superb deal,its highly unbelievable to get such an excellent model of IPhone on such a reasonable price. iPhone XR is a expensive branded phone and itís a water and dust resistant but After only three weeks use  i found dust in my cameraís lens . Iím extremely disappointed about this. Quite sturdy phone - though little heavy & bulky. Good efficiency & battery life. †Best Camera quality and best battery A great product at affordable price Loving the experience with the budget iPhone Not even completed 1 month but battery life became 99%, some defect may be will go and show some iphone store. Good apple thanks, Good product. Bad battery life Unfortunately having issue with screen Product received Manufacturers damage display and back panel gap and back panel damage received Calling Sensor is Not Good Enough And Also Sometimes Touch Stops Working for Few Seconds The phone is awesome. The one thing I disliked Earpods not met my expectations. Apple iPhone is iPhone.. Amazing feature Realy awsom phone. Best price 23,900. Thank you amazon. Like the looks and a valuable investment Order was delivered before the estimated time of delivery. Really enjoying the product. The best smart phone. And is better android phone Upgraded from android to iPhone with iPhone XR and this has completely impressed me. Good Camera, Excellent battery life and faster Face ID reading. this phone is strong, i have dropped it quite a few times. camera quality is good. the battery life is better than my poco. No issues in performance, flawless The smoothest phone ever. Best camera Apple product. I Rest my case Awesome phone Absolutely loved it. Upgraded from my old IPhone 6 to this beauty. I realized how slow my previous phone was after I started using this one and I got a great deal from Amazon. Fantastic phone?? ever Charging Adapter/wire not working properly have to adjust at different angles. Good performance..Believe me drop test done in 1st week of purchase, not intentionally by mistake fallen down but nothing happened..Thank God?????? Itís a very good and Original product. Wonderful product.. but need to update new version after unboxing?? m not satisfied with packing literally t phone comes with 1 simple plastic warped cover thats it. Facial recognition works great, camera is excellent and battery life is great too. Best Product, best performance, good camera quality, full day battery life, no hanging or any other issues. Very good but face unlock is slow good battery life and excellent display with good feature but required wifi to work or download any file over 200 mb Screen had a yellow tint. There was a manufacturing defect. Chek ed with other devices in showroom and all were normal white. Returned the device and claimed refund for this. There is no finger print sensor. But face id does a pretty good job. Love this phone. Camera is good but not the best. Bettery life is the best. Face recognition is fast and reliable even in dark condition.

       "'NOTE: Very bad experience with this iPhone xr phone. Back camera found defective and non functional. Amazon is very careless. I have not got any response on confirmation for replacing. I am just hanging with a damaged piece worth of more than 91000 rupees. Amazing phone with amazing camera coming from iPhone 7 plus great service from amazon So I got the iPhone XR just today. The product looks amazing. But unfortunately the Face ID is not working and thereís a glitch in the front cameraís portrait mode. Thatís fine, it may happen. But whatís not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple. Firstly, amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold. Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple! I have been an android user all my life until I decided to try iPhone XR for iOS. Loving the camera and battery life is an absolute joy to have. It is been more than one month since I got this phone and I am loving it. Face ID works flawlessly even in the dark and the dual sim function is working like a charm, I am using Vodafone as my primary sim and Jio as e-sim and have faced no problem whatsoever. I was delivered a phone that did not work immediately after removing from the box. I was not able to return it as I need to first check with Apple. Apple service told me that the phone was lying without charge since 5 months and hence the battery failed. Now I have had to leave the phone with Apple for repairs and waiting for them to replace the battery. Please answer this: WHY SHOULD I RUN AROUND FOR THE SUB PAR QUALITY DEVICE WHEN I WAS SHIPPED A DEAD PHONE? Last time I ever purchase a phone online It has been a month since I started using my iPhone XR and the experience has been awesome. Excellent battery life, smooth operating system, and most of all, dual Sim functionality are the best features of this iPhone. Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and Iím very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife. Only issue bothering me is the time taken to charge the phone. You need to opt for overnight charging. Other than that, extremely happy with the purchase. The phone is hanging. Video quality is not very good. I will use this review to mostly say what I am not a fan of in this particular iPhone model. Went with the iPhone XR after over a month of consideration.Amazon was offering some really good discounts and felt the time was right to upgrade having used the iPhone 6 for four seamless years.

Went with the iPhone XR after over a month of consideration.Amazon was offering some really good discounts and felt the time was right to upgrade having used the iPhone 6 for four seamless years. Best mobile  and my favourite Where nice XR Amazing futures and best camera so thanks for  Amazon Do not buy Apple products from Amazon. I got a defective product which is not activating. During first charging the iPhone started heating like anything. Since there was a 10 days replacement policy, so I asked Amazon to replace it as the product is defective. But very poor customer service from Amazon. They did not change the iPhone rather told me to visit service centre. Now I am with a defective product which is not operating. Face recognition is slower some times. I have no complaints about it. I am die hard fan of XR. I was eagerly waiting for dual sim iPhone. Itís heavy but looks are so attractive that you will be ready to carry that little extra weight. I am using it since two months. Donít watch any reviews. Just buy it and enjoy. Yes itís expensive. Sometimes rather many times money is not worth than happiness. Great Phone, I am happy with the phone so far. There are lots of reviews on net for XR, I would give just quick points based on my experience of XR 128 GB. Donít buy this phone only waste of money it hangís many time. STEVE JOBS GONE i phone gone !!!!!! Single SIM is working fine but if you are using E-sim in this phone. Not good quality for dual sim. Many times Number showing switched off. It is not supporting any type of sim.. the network gets disconnected after sometime only i always was unhappy with the size of my previous iPhones (iPhone 7 and 5s), I badly needed an upgrade and but donít have the budget of 1lakh so I took my chances with XR and I am very happy with my purchase. This is a product which let us down the whole high end feel of an iPhone. Apple has packed in a very sophisticated software hardware system in a rather disappointing design and the phone is bulkier and heavier than any of its competition in the market. The premium feel of the product is completely let down and left to enjoy is a good software interface of ios and an excellent camera. Overall a cheap buy for an apple lover but for a first time user the phone is totally let down. I Am facing some speaker related issues and had given my handset XR 64 Gb in service center they denied to repair the same stating that the handset is fake and not valid for any warrenty All in all an amazing product yet again from Apple. I know many people are confused wheather to go for an apple X or Xr. Well to be frank i suggest XR purely because of the fact that XR will have 1yr more support from Apple in respect to X.  Other than that the dual camera of X and single camera of XR have the same quality. As far as speed goes both are same. Xr is dual sim but you got to understand you can insert just 1 sim. The 2nd sim is an eSim which needs to be activated by Telecom service providers. There Is not much difference in display as well. All in all XR rules I had taken the phone but the phones holds too many defects and issues. When we talk the mouth pice is not that precise to hold you voice creaky the voice is not audible if the phone is even partially away from your chin/mouth. there are two angles from which smartphones are generally looked. and i will be very honest in this review so that a genuine user can understand if he really wants apple! Smooth as butter, no lag and awesome display with superb camera..Just the perfect phone Using around a week now. Itís snappy fast. Power efficient. Gives a back up of a whole day on average use. It has a single but impressive rear camera. Selfie camera is excellent. Low light performance is average though. The phone is bulky, Heavy, weighing more than 190 grams. You surely need to use a protective case to protect Camera bump and glass on both sides. Display is crisp. This is by far the best smartphone i have ever owned. A Perfect Phone with a great camera, great performance, Great look, Great Battery life and a good Display. Worth the trade off. Perfect size NEVER BUY it from Amazon. VERY POOR PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER CARE.i bought it and received it on 3.10.2019 and noted a crack on right top corner of display which was visible when the plastic sticker was removed and complained to amazon customer cell on 4.10.2019. they assured a replacement. nothing happened. when i called them a number of times, they simply tranfer my calls to diiferent sections and then assurinng call back and then not calling back. Apple says it is the duty of amazon to take measures for replacement. Still left nowhere with my money gone on a damaged product. Extremely easy to use. Good specifications. Best iPhone Iíve used. Sold my one plus 6 and got this one. The screen is not an OLED so you miss out on deep blacks and saturation. But I noticed the colours are better than the older iPhones with LCD. It also has thick bezels which take some time to get used to. An OLED screen on this wouldíve been wonderful but apple being apple will not do that! Poor Front camera cannot take photo with light at background (photo attached) This is my first phone from Apple. I was in confusion in buying between pixel and iphone. Even though pixel is far superior than apple in all departments, I went for iphone due to craziness. The product is well packed and delivered. When I started using the phone, the screen looks average, battery is good and the hardware seems good. The camera disappoints me al lot. Never expect this from Apple. In particular, the front camera is worst, in indoor lightning conditions and can see dots in image like a VGA camera.  At a cost of 60k, I was more so curious about the camera. It disappoints me badly. Even my motorola camera works well. If you are crazzy for the brand, go for it. Else definitely, you can go for other models in the market. This Appario seem to be a fraud. My shipment has been smartly tampered and the have managed to overcome the security features. Even iPhone package back label have been tampered. Amazon Customer Care on phone or Twitter is of no help. I need to return this and get a replacement. Most Beautiful, Fast and Stylish iPhone, I have ever Had.. Like every time, Apple has again mesmerised me with itís great creation iPhone XR. The best part in this is when you unbox your brand new iPhone. It comes with an earpod, and a Fast charger. I understand that the price might be a bit high but trust me, itís worth it. The camera has the best feature within it. Everyone says that itís an LCD screen but youíll nit be able to differentiate just by looking at the screen. The phone performance  is more faster now. And last but not the least, I am really impressed with the battery back up time. It really lasts. Full charge at 10 am and then the whole day on Cellular Data, I have played PES2019, played some songs from YouTube Music, hovering on Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook and clicked some good photos. When i came back home at 11 oíclock, i still had 66% charge. Thatís what we needed in an iPhone. iPhone XR is excellent there is no doubt about this. This first time my iPhone experience. Its great experience. But I am very unhappy about the dual sim performance (May be solved the problem). Been a iPhone user always. Upgraded to iPhone XR from iPhone 6 and I have no regrets. Just love the ease that face recognition brings in... freedom that 128GB memory brings in... and of course peace of mind that Apple brand name brings in. the phone will not turn on A lot of criticism of iPhone XR has been about its inability to take portrait pics of ìonly human faces!î Though true, it can be very easily overcome by downloading a software app - ìHalide!î That and the near negligible difference in viewing experience, puts it on par with iPhone XS and even XS Max! Just go for itó the 256 GB storage version! Prices have fallen by rs 10000 in 3 days after I bought my phone. I feel terrible. Faulty product delivered and Amazon not giving replacement. Cheating with customer and just making money by scam and defective product delivery. Phone is not usable as display stop working randomly and screen freeze suddenly. I have provide problem video also to Amazon within 10 days of replacement but Amazon just making money and cheating with customer. †Iphone is good but probably I have received a defective piece from amazon as I am facing issues with software. Further never heard a iphone to be hanging issue but I am facing the same and attached a video regarding it. Within a month I have to visit customer care and still facing issues. Very worst experience donít buy it from amazon. Super fast performance, long battery hours, little heavier than iphone 7 plus. Overall good phone. Has many drawbacks. Apps developed for iPhone by Indian Companies arenít good at all. You canít even do a normal Tatkal booking as irctc app unavailable. No dual Whatsapp so one number is wasted. No dual Facebook as well. Maximum 5gb cloud backup storage limit. Apps get refreshed more frequently and better enhancements on android. No features to search apps easily. Wifi once disconnected loses auto join features. Maximum 100 call records thatís very very annoying. Difficult to set primary and secondary sims in sms. Some Whatsapp features missing. It is heavy weight if you use more ull feel it hard to hold on regular note! There have been multiple issues faced since started installing and restoring from icloud. Gets hanged/stuck, suddenly WiFi gets disconnected and does not get connected till restart, deteriorated network speed on usage of the data..... First off, the battery life is INCREDIBLE! This is the first phone I have used where I can get two days of use on one charge! I would regularly charge the phone overnight one night, then go to bed at midnight with 55-60% left the next night, leave it unplugged, and finish the next day at midnight with around 2-5%. The size of the phone was just just about perfect for holding/scrolling with one hand, and I usually wear menís size medium gloves for reference. When compared with XS only visible difference would be screen, that too when kept side by side. Awesome IPhone.. I have upgraded from iPhone 6 and I can notice the significant different in display, touch and XR is certainly faster. Itís worth the upgrade..! Thank you Amazon for delivering it securely. Got this phone for offer price. Everything is great from packing to delivery. Display quality is very good. Dual sim option is very good, got esim from airtel Bought this phone for my wife. She is absolutely happy with the phone. I want to replace this iphone because since i got this it worked well for w week then later on its speed is slowed down and even it hangs sometimes. Its been 3 months since i got this n i m already irritated with this device. My lighting usb has already stopped working . Great phone for better photos and low light battery usage is much better than X So overall itís a pretty nice phone, I honestly donít find much difference in features from my old iPhone 6. Apart from face recognition. Good phone Iíve been using Android for close to a decade and now decided to check out iOS. Thanks to Amazon Prime Sale, got iPhone XR for a discounted price(Still expensive), Coming to the iPhone itself, after using phone for 3 days, below are the points I came across. Using this phone since 2 months. Here is my review. Hope you will find it useful. I was skeptical looking at some XR reviews and also purchasing an iPhone off Amazon (previously always bought through Apple Stores). However, so far happy with what I have. The delivery was fast (on Prime, next day); all original packing (phone box) and phone is working fine. Touchwood - no issues. The Deal was good with the 10% additional HDFC discount. Go for 128 GB (or even higher) - the few extra thousand are worth it when you run out of space. I got a defective iPhone XR. The screen is defective. Thereís a blue shade on all the four sides of the screen. The phoneís working completely fine though.  So whoever purchased the phone while unboxing please check your device thoroughly. It was my mistake that i thought that maybe itís something related to software which will be fixed after software update but it didnít. And in that belief i skipped my 10 days return policy as well. I still donít blaim amazon because i have purchased my Airpods from them as well. But still appario should not sell defective products to customers. Now i have to go through a hassle of getting the screen replaced from service centre and for that service centre will keep my phone for at least 7-10 days. Itís disappointing that i have to go through all this for a brand new phone. The reason why i didnít upload a pic is bcuz it will not be visible in a pic taken from another phone. ALL good †I chose iPhone XR over x. The reasons are, it is 6.1-inch display and supports dual sim. the Battery Durability longs last. I got the Brand New peace (made in 2019, September) without any defect. During the great India sale, I saw this model on offer and my sister was dying to get a new phone since her old phone was barely keeping up. I finally made up my mind,, arranged the funds and got it for my sister. Phone looks beautiful. I bought it just one month before thru Amazon, when I put my sim it is speaker has not been working , it is difficult to listen voice sometimes it becomes disconnected. Although my android phone is working good at the same place. I do not know whom should I contact about my complaint. After transition from Android to iOS, I felt Android is more user friendly compared to iOS. I am not able to activate iphone after several attempts. Today only i purchased. Hello friends!! This is my honest review after using it for almost 2 months. I was using android since last seven years but then I decided to go for iPhone. Here are the pros and cons according to me which I have felt after using it for almost 2 months So upgrading from 6S+ to XR. First reactions: Everything look good but I never expect. Upgraded from 5s to xr after 3 years of 5s use. Purchased it at ?37999 after low battery issues with 5s. Why I choose xr rather than iPhone 8 ,7 or even 6s even when I bought 5s after 3 years of its initial launch is Before I start this review Iíll let you know, I love the Apple brand and Iíve never used a 1080p OLED phone in my life (This screen seems perfectly normal to me). That being said Iíll dive into the review. I got this phone on the Prime day sale and Iíve been using it for almost a month now and here are my thoughts about this phone. Got this product in the amazon flash sale and got a decent discount. Have been using the device for a few days and can certainly say that this iPhone has the best battery life till date. Phone lasted for almost 30 hours with heavy usage. The face recognition has certainly been improved from iPhone X. The only thing I dislike about the phone is the Screen Quality. You wonít find any major difference in the screen quality unless and until you stream Netflix or watch YouTube. Overall I feel this is one of the best iPhones apple has launched. You will always feel cheated after buying an iPhone. It will get cheaper by every next 2-3 months. I have been using this phone for a while now. When I decided to buy this phone I checked on negative reviews first and after buying thought of using it first and then give a feedback. This is the perfect Phone with all advanced features for a normal user, which is worth for the price. Moving unto the flaws seen on the feedbacks, most of them complaining about the display being low resolution and LCD. In my opinion you wonít spot any difference with other iPhone displays. Another thing Iíve seen than lot of people complaining about the single camera, however, the picture quality you get will amuse you. Bought this during Prime sale. I love to use Apple products because of its simplicity. I was using iPhone 6 and thought of updating. While the XS and XS Max are more than a Lakh in India, iPhone XR is bang for the buck. The prime day deal was more sweet and surprise to me. The operation and touch responses are silky smooth. Dual Sim with the eSIM works like a charm. Rear camera is awesome with face detection AI Bookeh in Portrait mode. Screen resolution is very good and crisp without any pixel issues. It lacks 3D Touch but Apple incorporated Taptic Engine which will be updated to replace 3D Touch functionality eventually (though some are present now, it is limited). Some APPs are not good in the notch area though but it is ok to manage. Overall a nice update. Received the product next day only but packaging was not good as it is a cellphone box they should cover it with some thing  Phone is working fine but some times apps automatically closes I am a bit confused if it is a genuine product or not  I would suggest people not to buy from amazon you should go to your nearest store and buy it I am a recent convert from Android. I have used Samsung and Xiaomi phones earlier. Here is my initial impression: Donít get swayed by some lame reviewers on YouTube. If you r holding out for an iPhone purchase then this is the real deal. The Xr is a jack of all trades although not excelling in any. The A12 Bionic is a beast,níuff said already, the stereo speakers sound sweet and battery life is great. I found the most bashed about lcd display very pragmatic for everyday use.The portrait shots taken with the camera look a stunner.With the reason price cut , this has turned out to be the VFM iPhone ever made Received product yesterday and product looks perfectly awesome. Excellent phone. I am using it since 3 months. No problem. Classy product. Bought during Diwali sale @39k. Excellent battery backup lasting more than a day. Mind that I am a heavy user. Excellent photos. SIRI works well. No issues faced. Must go for it over other Chinese product in this price segment. Iphone not working since I opened the box. Apple support of little help. Amazon not taking the return. Asking for a report from Apple. Now I have to chase Apple to get a report. Nightmare starts when you buy from Amazon. There are many pros about this phone which you must be already aware of . I would like to point out at cons Face ID and front camera portrait mode is not working just after 3 months of purchase. It must be a problem of true depth sensor. My city (Imphal) apple servicing centre does not allow me to take for servicing and tells me to go to Guwahati (Assam) for this problem. May be a coincidence because this problem happened when I used amazon basics 10w fast wireless charger which I combine with xiaomi quick charge 3 I was using iphone 6 since last three years before switching to Iphone XR. The following are the things that impressed me the most. Camera superb I bought this iPhone XR from October Amazon Great Indian Festival at deep discount. At Rs 38000 after all discounts were applied was a WOW deal. THANK YOU Amazon. Nothing can beat iPhone. This is my fourth phone (iPhone SE, iPhone 6, iPhone 8 and now this) purchased from Amazon. All are excellent phones. Except for screen resolution, iPhone XR is nothing less than XS or XS Max. In fact, the battery life is twice as that of iPhone 8. Face recognition is excellent even in dark while android phones lack this technology. White is a beautiful color. Delivery was before scheduled deadline and in good external packing. I was bit worried about the authenticity of buying iphone online with unknown seller and by paying huge amount ,I took the  Risk but i would say amazon and seller  has done a wonderful job ,i checked the product  in apple website and its a genuine product with 1 year warranty..iphone is iphone with best processor,camera ,good battery life ,good for gaming and with  regular  updates from apple .. IOS: Itís a very awesome mobile. Overall itís really good. Hats off to apple that they provide these kind of of awesome products. The iPhone XR goes blank the next day!!! Was sceptical at first. But after I received the phone itís good and in mint condition. I am upgrading from iPhone 7 and itís worth it. My iPhone 7 was 3 years old, and was lagging before I took the leap. Camera is more like the android phone with some Chinese lens I think. Battery life is so soothing! Face recognition is like butter. (Donít know what will happen in the future) best part upgrading is the screen  size. Totally worth it. Videos are a bit dull but for the cost itís worth it!! Thank you amazon for not sending a duplicate phone. Well after buying this iPhone i am never switching back to android. In two months the phone got destroyed its screen is filled with water its ip certification is nil bloody ios..... Battery quality is worst I have honor 8c and it gives 2 days backup and this phone last only 12 hours with medium usage no fast charger takes tradatitional 3 hours for full charging if you want to waste your money then go for it if you r not brand conscious buy other brands phone with much more better  configurations that too almost half of its price Their is No earpods no lightning cable or connector in that box and will call after few minutes it blanks the call,not even a bip. Kindly give me some suggestions to rectify that Got it for 38k during prime early access, one of the best purchase for value of money is considered. iOS 13 future releases might make it even more snappier and battery consumption efficiency. Played WOW Blitz in 60FPS and found no issues. Will post the PUBG and Fortnite review in few days. Battery back up is about 6hrs screen on time for apps usage scenario. I ordered this phone on Diwali offer. The phone which I got first had display issue , so I got replacement for that.my previous phone was iPhone 6 Plus.  After one week of using this phone, these are my honest review.  Firstly the phone has excellent battery life . For average use, the battery lasts more than a day easily. Although charging takes time ie about 2 to 3 hours from 10% to 100%. As I am used to iPhone home button, Iím feeling a bit uncomfortable with this phone as it has no home button. You have to swipe up every time from bottom to top to unlock the phone. It has no finger print sensor . So itís a bit difficult to unlock while ur in bed as you have to put ur face in front of the phone for FACE ID. Reach ability is an issue if you use one handed. Especially while using Facebook, when you have to swipe down from bottom line to make ur finger reach the top screen clicking options. Display of the screen is a bit below iPhone 6 Plus. So all in all the phone is just about satisfactory. Good at 52k (the price at which I got the phone). The phone wasnít worth 76k when it was launched but at 52k it justifies itself. I have bought it during prime sales , aside from discount i have bought it by paying just 36k It is the latest offering from I phone. Simply great. Camera is superb. The glass back looks ultra premium, though I would suggest you to get a back protective case as glass is fragile. Got it in white and had to pay 1400 extra but it looks the best in white. You are spending 60000 on a phone so what is 1400 more to get the best Fantastic mobile. Nicely integrated hardware and software nothing ever comes close to an Apple product. Smooth touch no lag, face identification works well. Camera is good. Battery lasts for 24 hours with moderate usage. Superb audio and video quality and iOS updates are always smooth. The apps are wonderful.??Amazon delivery was on dot. the same offer is available at authorized reseller stores which happens around the time Apple launches a new version of iPhone. IPhone SIM CARD SLOT NOT WORKING right from the beginning. Dude i was confused first that which one i should buy oneplus 7pro or iphone xr, so i choosen xr for 40k on offer and every thing ia good but i am dissapointed with tha camera quality and display quality really i have iphone 7plus also but the display is far far better then xr and the camera is also better but i know iphone 7plus has dual camera and that is ok but dude detailing is missing and also zooming is also missing we get digital zoom which reduces tha quality.... In my initial review, I said that the iPhone XR was the best iPhone for most people right, and my thoughts about it have not changed six months later. This is still the best iPhone in the market, offering the same smooth and terrific user experience as the more expensive iPhone XS and XS Max, but with the knowledge that you are also getting the best battery life. In fact, the battery life is at par, if not better, to what the P30 Pro and the Galaxy S10+ offer and that is saying something. I am facing cellular network issue with every new update. As per my understanding, Hardware is not compatible with the OS. I have purchased this Apple iPhone XR (64GB) - Black for my use. I got it during great Indian festival for 38,000rs. Great value for the price. it has a receiver failer problem It was my first iphone till date i was an android user . But believe me once you get over these phones you will not switch it away iPhone XR is still a great buy. The price VS performance ratio on this phone makes it a very sensible buy. If you donít care about the latest and greatest this one year old offering from Apple is a far better buy. Only down side on the phone are as follows:- Never thought about purchasing XR but could not stop myself when i saw this deal . Taken sudden decision and bought this. Very much worried till the delivery suspecting that the product would be refurbished or duplicate. But amazon kept thier commitment, i received a brand new orginal iphone. First of all the Face ID is crazy fast and accurate even during pitch darkness. The phone is fast and smooth, you donít feel like you are having just 3Gb of RAM, it handles anything you through at it without a hitch. The phone does feel premium and at the same time delicate because the backside is glass,îas you know glass is glass and glass will breakî. The pictures taken from the camera are good but the lack of night scape sort of things is a con. Overall the phone is great, although the side bezels are thick, you get used to it. The LCD screen does not lack anything compared to the OLEDís in day to day usage. You just stop thinking those things when you are using daily. I was looking to upgrade from my iPhone 6 and was confused about iPhone 11 & iPhone XR. Decided to go for iPhone XR just from the cost perspective. Only from Camera and Processor POV there is an upgrade in iPhone 11 rest remains the same. Bought it for 45k during sale I had been using iphone 8 plus before and not a single time did I ever experience that phone heating up even after extensive usage. This piece however heats up to the extent making it uncomfortable to hold. If I use it for less than 10 mins, it works fine but any usage beyond that makes it hot. And on top of that, if the brightness level is set to max, its becomes an iron box(pun intended). Not expected off an apple device ! the screen has a slight dot at the bottom which i noticed while fixing guard. If it comes out as mfr defect apple will certainly fix it. but does not seem serious, will take to apple while it is still in warranty to know more and update. Got the 128 GB model since an iPhone almost always run out of space and never have the option for an SD card like Android devices. Overall the product is good from face id to Liquid retina. One thing surely standout for me is its surrounding speakers, they are really good(as per my experience), i got impressed With the work they have put in speakers. Sound is loud and clear. M an iphone addict... my first was iphone 4, then 6 which my brother gifted me but this time i upgraded to xr with my own salary n m really happy ... specially the battery life.... and  As i do not use camera much so potrait mode is not of much use to me.. face id recognition very nice... though you do not get the feel of holding iphone as it little bit big and on bulky side as compared to my iphone 6.... rest fuctioning everything is smooth so i think its worth the purchase... and if you have iphone 6 or 7 than only go for upgrade as i did lot of research and 8 and xs and xr they almost similar except for few features.... I am more or less stuck with the iOS platform because of the iwatch since I love its functionality. Upgraded from my 3yr old iPhone 7, was actually waiting for prices to drop post September this year  but when Amazon came up with an unbelievable prime deal, I couldnít resist! Easy to use, serves the purpose. I was an android guy for like last 7 years before that was using blackberry in between switched to ios as i used iphone 5c but at that time i was a bit disappointed may be because quite young i was and a bit techie but now i use my phone for basic purposes like calls, what is app, email, social media n bit gaming n music so it really handles that well though i was a bit hesitant at first as i was used to of finger touch sensor but seriously face recognition is damn good it works like a charm even when there is no light, so if you want no nonsense stuff n if it suits your requirements then go for it as now a days even droids are equally expensive in-fact some are more expensive like fold, razr etc. so just listen to your heart and buy ios or android and you will not go wrong, though i got mine in an offer for ?43000 for 128 GB variant Purchased this phone for a friend and he is very happy with the performance of the phone. Camera quality and features are the industry standard. For anyone refraining from buying an iPhone because it has only a single SIM slot,  please be informed that this Phone does support Dual SIM if you use E-SIM. Airtel and Jio, for now, has E-SIM facility. For a more detailed review do visit my review website at excitedneurons(dot)com Awesome product !! Far better than spending almost double for Xs, XS MAX, 11 as the difference is only display and camera. Otherwise everything is same. It would be definitely a bigger upgrade if anyone is switching from iphone 8 or 8+ to it. The entire UI is different. Icing on the cake is the PRIVACY, its the utmost priority of Apple it seems. Without you face id, nobody can see even the notifications. Its a must buy product. I still donít understand why people are crazy about iPhone. I bough this phone for 42k in great Indian sale couldnít find much difference so for. Itís been a week now. My old android is doing all the operation faster then this which detected my face quickly. And that has fingerprint support also. I am also crazy about this phone. My friend told that he will never go back to android again. Thatís the one reason for me to buy this phone. Let me wait for one more month to become addicted.  Till then Iíll leave the rating to 4*. When you think that this phone is expensive, thatís proving that this phone is for royal customers :p. Go for it if you are affordable. I have received this product with manufacturing defect in it. Screen has LED bleeding problem. Contacted the service team of Apple and they are ready to replace. The iPhone XR is by far the best that Apple had to provide in the recent years with no doubt. Right from the camera to its horsepower battery backup, everything is top notch. I bought XR after 11 came out. I read a few articles and saw a few video reviews which said that the real difference between the phones was the camera and that it was negligible and not worth the price difference. My Opinion-I do not know why people are saying it is an excellent display, personally i do not like the display at all, No doubt colour accuracy is good, Touch response is good, but it not that sharp, text looks blurry. I have been using my iPhone XR for over 10 months now. So far, everything\\'s hunky-dory. Thanks to amazon for giving it for great deal, iphone xr 128gb is absolutely fantastic, with good battery life, camera, and performance. Since 6 months waiting to upgrade from 6s, compare to 6s xr a bit bigger in screen size for me apart from that its a great device to use, thanks to the seller 3 years back got 6s from the same seller and it still works pretty well without any issues. I love this phone... especially since I wanted it for a long time... would recommend it for both apple owners and those looking to become iPhone owners...camera quality is amazing... was able to activate the esim without hazzels.. 2 reasons that I switched my old phone for...size was a concern initially since I was accustomed to only iPhone 5, SE, 6... lightning cable is a disadvantage  with this phone as the charging point n headset points are the same... but I knew it when I was getting it... so got used to it now I believe firmly that this is the Best Affordable Phone Apple has ever made!!! Battery life will surely amaze the buyer, I use to charge my iPhone 7 Plus at the 100 percent to my office at 10AM  and while returning by 7 PM it used to be approx 7-8 percent remaining. I use my phone for basic tasks and PUBG during break. Now when XR came to my hand the very first day I forgot to charge my phone to 100 percent and took it to my office at 62 percent. Amazingly it had 33 percent charge while I was leaving my office and I even played 3 evoground matches of pubg that day during my break. It was my dream to have long lasting iOS enabled devices which came true with this spectacular device. One should blindly go for it if performance and battery is your huge concern. Wow Wow Apple iPhone XR Looks Amazing In Stunning White Colour Thanks To Amazon For Giving For Best Price In The Market Love You Amazon For Quick Delivery But Packaging  Is Not That Great It Should Be In More Secure Packaging  When Comes To Phone After 8 Years I am Using Again iPhone Before I Used iPhone 4s Now Again Coming Back From Android Phones To IOS Makes mee feel Happy And This Phone Is a beast go for it . I was always an iPhone user  till 8+ , then thought of changing to note 8 I loved that phone too but over the period of time I started realising there is nothing like IOS and iPhone. After using two high end androids (i keep changing phones) I witched back to iPhone and OMG I must say it has even become better it is so smooth like a butter on pan and IPhone X r is beauty, Liquid Retina is awesome and beautiful will not make you miss oled also the battery back up is woooowww .  This is the first ever phone I bought thru AMAZON I was skptical but thought of taking risk and yes Amazon delivered what they promised thru FREEDOM sale got a very good deal for 128 gb everyday I fall in love with this phone .. 6.1 inches screen for a phone is pretty good, feels heavy, but all that pales in comparison after the actual features of the phone are unlocked.I was informed that phone can be tracked even when switched off as per the new ios 13 update, camera quality is better , both front and back , fast charging too is great, i like the idea that the body is aluminium made as compared to the latest which after checking and reviewing holds up better after drop tests, face id recognition is great, but need back up in the form of app lock for unauthorized usage.Overall a great phone, at a amazing price, do not miss the chance to buy it, even if you feel it is heavy on your wallet, you will not get such a good phone loaded with features else where.Its like how the iphone 7 was the benchmark for future models , same goes for this phone. Excellent deals offered by Amazon 38k after bank discount.......best iPhone for every aspect.......good camera ...... battery backup excellent......... looks elegant.....feels premium in hand.....and  one think i said to all , though it is a 720p display but display is excellent quality.......there is no panicked about it....and also played 1080p video in YouTube.......so .....go for it.......this is best budget iPhone at this price point......thank you Amazon........ I bought 128g  at 57k performing much faster and more smoother experience on an iPhone. Battery life is above average. app switching is lightning fast. I love it <3 I phone always like a dream phone... purchased this  in diwali sale in 38 k rs. My previous phone was s8 moved to xr and no regrates. Thank you amazon i got iphone XR 64GB black variant for 38000/- on big billion day sale Top end model IPhone XR with the Price of 42k?? Extremely satisfied... I was an android user for 6yrs and this was my first upgrade to iPhone.. Battery Standby is just next to impossible in any smart phones these days, Face ID fab!(One dis - If I covet half of my face during bike riding, it doesnít recognise me??) Good phone. Go for it if you want an iPhone experience. Truth be told, I do miss a finger print sensor. But, at updating to iOS 13 the performance of the Face ID head become significantly faster. I will not recommend anyone to buy XR,if you are considering iphone from camera perspective. There is nothing to dislike about this phone. I forgot Android after using this. This is superior class,you ll feel it when you hold it. Do not be a sad face for 3GB Ram, it is better than 8GB Android. Facelock can recognize you in dark. There is no finger print scanner. But still it is no issues First of all got it for 38000.  Great at this price but or maximum at 45k nothing more than that for this phone. I was previously a user of iPhone SE and was wonderstruck with its abilities. But due to battery life had to look at a changeover. However looking at the price was little suspicious whether the phone would be worth for the money. Here are the pros n cons... This phone is good , i got it at Rs.45000 during this diwali sale, but after using this i was bound to think on the various aspects : considering the Ram and ROM ( 3 GB and 64 GB ) in this case , is the price ok , i felt that its really overpriced, we can get more features in Phones like Redmi Note 8 pro which is priced at around 16K ( discounts and bank offer are separate) this means we are paying for brand name or goodwill price simply to Apple. Then why we are not going for One plus models made in china as Apple i phone is also made in china for your information. This is my first iPhone after 10 years of being an android user. This review is after using this phone for 2 months. The performance has been top notch, battery life is very good considering  most of my days are moderate to heavy usage I still find 20-30 % battery the next day. Camera is good too but at time you miss the secondary lens for portraits and portraits donít work on objects. I am writing this review after using this phone for more than 10 days now . I upgraded this phone from iPhone 7 . The phone is really good , worth a buy if its on good sale .  128gb - around 55k I am using apple from last 7 years. And never change apple phone frequently. I was using iPhone 6s from last 3 years but due to less space and batter backup, I need to upgrade it. I choose Apple iPhone because it is in between AppleXS and Apple X. Hardware A12 bionic chipset with 3 GB ram give my phone high speed on top of 128GB space thrilled the whole experience. In this new apple XR I still missed the center button especially when I play the games. Camera output is an amazing especially back camera. Also would like to appreciate the battery backup, I hardly change more than one time in 24hours. Now I do not need to my battery back always along with me ROFL. The best decision that I took was to give away my Samsung galaxy S8 and get this phone. I was skeptical at first considering on paper specs and the obvious inferior display. But I used it in a retail store and I didnít mind the display at all. It was one drawback that i could live with if i was getting everything much better than on the android side at the price range. Iphone is good. It do not have fingerprint reader, only faceid and password. iPhone XR performs better than those specs that it showed in paper for XR. A reasonably good product if you are into the Apple ecosystem and do not want to splurge. Looks great and behaves well too. Camera is quite good for its resolution. Excellent battery life. Thank god I got rid of my android phone, finally! Gifted my wife with this phone for her birthday. Thanks to amazon for the fast delivery and maintaining their quality standards. iPhone XR with A12 bionic chip with 3 GB RAM is fast. This is my 1st iPhone and I am very impressed with it is performance, processing power is fast and iPhone is very easy to use and it fits in my hand very well. This is my first iPhone. Iím happy with the performance of XR. With hdfc credit card discount and exchange of old phone, it costed me 49.7k. Both front and rear Camera quality is great, battery lasts whole day with normal use. Face recognition is better than OnePlus 6T. XRís almost HD display  can give tough competition to major FHD phones, side by side you wonít be able to spot any difference. Display is so crisp, no eye strain. And ios is buttery smooth. XR is more value for money than XS or X Best mobile compare to other Apple mobiles Awesome cellphone i have ever used..i have switched from Android(OP) to ios..which I believe..it cannot be compared with any os we have  in market..coming to the device itís really awesome battery on an average use last for a day..i don not play any game..I mostly spend time on Twitter and on other apps...the only worst thing i find is the charging rate which really sucks...it takes appx an hour to full juice. Camera has been the best...not as good as of Samsung s series and note series  but for me its the best...face recognition works like charm... Its Apple so no comments on their quality and user experience. Fabulous purchase got it at 43K which is worth and enjoying it Got this iPhone XR 128GB in an awesome deal of rs. 42,999 thanks to amazon. need i say anything about this phone! it is a bomb. i bought the product red 64GB varient and let me tell you its sexier than it appears in the pictures. camera quality is really good. the portraits are awesome even though it has a single lens. the bezzel looks a bit wide compared to XS and XS Max, but if you are upgrading from Iphone 8 Plus or lower you will not find it different. The liquid display is really nice with wide range of colors displayed really well. i got this during the independence day sale for Rs.52K and its definitely a great deal. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED! To review iPhone! Probably the only one I could afford but totally worth it. This is the best value for money you can get. iPhone 11 has only a marginal improvement compared to iPhone XR. But the performance is almost at par with them. I had an iPhone 6s, which ran almost 4 years. Touch and feel you get from your iphone is unparalleled with any other phone.(I have used all platforms) I bought a iphone XR  ,Which has some screen and camera issues  ,screen is freezing ,Amazon custome r Care talk like we did mistake ,not gud behaviour called to amazon ,they asked to go Apple store,already visited there from apple support we got information battery already replaced of this IMIE number.I told them ,but they were not agree,they again and again saying go there,we cannot replace it.we just requested also said we paid 50000 for that but they do not agree,so if you buying pn and you have any issue in phone even it would be damaged they are not going to replace IT,and this seller is selling refurbish product. Great phone! Best ux in the class, no offense android but why does my calculator need permission to access my contacts? Not sure whether genuine product. Bought it on the first day of amazon sale. Within 15days, got a vertical line in the middle of display- see photos. Have bought 5 apple devices in the past and never had any problem with any of them so far. Since the return window closes within 19 days have to now take it to apple service center. Seriously makes me thing about the originality of the product. Good phone. Great screen size. But apple still has not fixed low light shooting. It still looks like crap when compared to oppo or Samsung or the +one series. Itís incredible how we end up paying so much for an iPhone which still doesnít get its camera right. Battery life is good. Downside is the replacement of the phono jack for headphones with its lightning socket which operates both charger and headphones - which means you can only do one thing I just got my iPhone XR 128GB White phone. I feel am lucky to get 12% discount on MRP. In addition 10% discount on my Credit card. Also an 2% instantaneous cashback on a special day. Total paisa-vasool!! Got it after discount for 43000+ additional value of 4000 on phone exchange. Feels like got robbed by apple I bought it for 64990 and after 10 days of launching iPhone 11 the price of this phone reduced to 54990 10000 drastic drop. Its bionic A12 chip is good and smooth but battery performance is bad, and it does not even have  Fingerprint sensor, the face detection will not work at all angles. Need to stop buying this apple product. The iPhone is a great phone, but I am really impressed with amazon. I recieved the phone in less than 36hrs and checked the warranty and coverage on the Apple website. Everything was right in place, turns out I was unnecesarily hesitant to purchase the phone online. Also got one year screen insurance free in addition to the heavy discount! †My review after one month of use Pathetic experience with this phone . Bought it for 60K and not worth the price . Assembled in China and lot many issues with battery and other features . Better to buy from stores which are assembled in India and are cheaper with better quality check . Learnt hard way to never but electronics from amazon . I hot this product with 37K during big billion sale  ,and the product is super but it is not for you if you are a camera freak . Back camera and front camera both are good but front camera night vision is not enough . Over all battery life is good . Potrait mode  photos also good (without having a dual back camera) Not going to lie while I was transferring my iCloud stuff, the phone got heated up to the point where I had to switch it off and then start over again. The best camera and feel of security... This is my 4th apple product. As usual, itís apple works fine . Will easily can last upto 4 years. Battery- is just awesome, can last you full working day with heavy useage. My second iphone and 3rd apple product so i can clearly say that if you are the first time user of apple product then you will surely give iphone XR 5 star rating but if you have been a long run user then you will think twice to give even 4 star also to this, may be after demise of Steve jobs apple has compromised with its quality, where as in till 2015 there were no comparison with any phone with iphone but now few products are giving strong comparison to it, apple is now only encashing its name but it will not good for the future of apple because now a days consumers are more aware, and if you are not giving 5 star to iphone the. Probably you have dealt with a wring product, sorry but not completely happy with XR. May be i will think next time when i will be upgrading my phone. Best battery life in an iPhone. Awesome experience. Camera, performance and battery life is great. Totally worth every penny spent! 1.The battery life is good. I got a very bad product from Amazon. This was really not expected from Amazon. i do not know whether its an issue from Apple or Amazon. From the day it has come it started giving me issues.Issues related Hardware like Distorted sound i.e. Other person cannot listen the voice clearly, voice becomes like mute, and Software Issues like Phone getting hanged [NEVER HEARD IOS HANGING], Not able to unlock the phone moreover not able to recieve a call. I am the first time user to the iPhone and got this sort of bad experience which was never thought of or never expected.I am really disappointed with the product.Also I think Battery Life can be improved. Camera quality and Face reader is OK. Thanks to Amazon for putting it on sale for 43K . Wonderful phone to have at such price . Battery life is perfect for heavy users . Although a double camera would have made it perfect. Honestly speaking I love apple products due to the simple design and fluid user experience with the products. I am a fan of black but i got the Product RED as part of the amount goes for HIV research. This phone is just awesome. Screen is really good and bright, you canít really make a difference between the screen and an AMOLED screen. I have compared them side by side. You canít really say the difference. Note: No fingerprint reader in the phone so please consider it as the review of face id. Received a faulty set, had to take it to a service centre within 2 months and they had to replace it with a new phone. Good purchase during the sale. I like it. Moved from 6 to XR, which makes it bulky in your hand. But i will get use to it. Battery backup is good. I love the photos clicked in Protrait mode. Good phone. Being a 1st time user of ios, i liked it a lot. Although the compromises made for this phone like inferior display, big bezels nd notch are cleary visible and annoying. Battery life is top notch although supplied 5 watt charger is a trash. Using my iPad charger to charge it fast. Camera gives dslr quality pics in daylight nd outdoors but night photos are below average. In total a good package to try out apple ecosystem. I purchased this phone from amazon during the freedom sale got it for an effective price 49k . This is my first iphone and honestly not regretting a bit . I was worried about the specs such as LCD screen and camera quality but it did not disappoint me this one camera on XR is 1000 times better than those Three cameras on my samsung A50 and the LCD screen hardly makes a difference its crystal clear and vibrant . The battery life is just beautiful it can stand for 48hours on a single charge . Overall it a good buy , Apple is never great with specs but the always kills it The phone was not getting power on.. It is a fabulous product. I am sure everyone knows it is quality. Only one thing that I should mention here regarding the battery. I was definitely expecting a better battery life in the normal mode. It is merely giving a day with normal usage in that mode. However, in the Low Power Mode, its giving a great battery life without compromising any regular features of the phone. My experience with iPhones was never bad but this time with iPhone XR the phone started hanging from the very first month, it has not yet been a month and is already hanging.. did not expect this from apple gadgets. everything else is good the battery life , camera but its a little heavy, heats up and has started HANGING. Since from a lot of months i have been waiting to buy an iPhone XR in great Indian sale and as more than I expected I bought this mobile for a huge price drop thanks to Amazon for that.I ordered on Saturday noon 1 Pm and I got the product on the next day early morning 7 Am a super fast delivery from Amazon. If you are an Android user, you will find iPhone difficult in many respects. Firstly iPhone is not google friendly. Google updates will not happen automatically. Many free apps found in Android phones are not available in iPhone set up or you have to pay dearly. And there are many moreeeeeee...... This is my first iPhone and I am being excited. Close to a month now and I am still saying my new iPhone. Hi Team, I do not understand why would anyone use any other phone other than Iphone.  God please forgive their ignorance. They know not what they are missing My iphone was excellent bt i want my iphone complete bill...in box I canít receive bill Waited for a long time to get this mobile Want to return but you are not accepting it.. Bad experiance on amazon... Really paying a huge amount and giving bad quality products.... The product is awesome i have brought the same in Sep & there has been no issues itís currently running on IOS 13.2.2 & the phone is very fast it also has e-sim which is a major plus point face recognition is very good without any hassle & the battery is good enough to take it for a day & half. As this phone was bought after APPLE TV + was released we have received a annual subscription free with the product from 1st Nov 2019 Pls pls do not buy from amazon or any other site buy it from store because i got a defected xr its face id is not working and it is having heating issues and now amazon is also not replacing it This is my third iPhone and I must say - each time Apple introduces an iPhone, they improve a lot in each model. iPhone XR is one of best selling iPhone for year 2018. Its not that cheap but still standout in crowd. Its not expensive than iPhone XS but still have all the features same as other top models- only difference is OLED screen but I can live with that. Recently introduced iPhone 11 and XR have only one difference which is of Price. Most of the features are exactly same. Best Battery backup ever in an iPhone I must say. Soothing and flawless iOS.  Camera is more than average and very much improved as compared to previous generations. Glass frame back and front and very appealing to eyes. Overall, a satisfactory experience with this device. A must buy if are considering iPhone 11 but have low budget. Fingerprint reader given one star coz it has Face ID ??, it works lightning fast (even in the dark) , super build quality, battery backup is nuts (works for more than 2 days with decent use) , Camera quality is amazing for photography and videography. Preferred product over iphone X if screen quality is not the main thing to notice (does not matter if you do not watch 4K videos on youtube) Using an iPhone after 6 years. Have been using Android and the transition is bit difficult as I am used to having different functions. Happy with product, it is not as bulky as I assumed. Vibrant colour and smooth functioning. Delivery was also very quick. Looks: 5 /5 Display 3.7/5 ó but you will get use too it not too bad better than expensive android phones  (DO NOT BUY IF DISPLAY IS YOUR PRIORITY) Only face recognition and no fingerprint. I think the phone is very good. Screen could be little smaller However these days only big screen phones are being launched so let us wait for future. Heyaa! I just purchased Iphone couple of weeks back and its been 15days of my experience with iphone! This is the first ever Iphone for me and i am super excited to buy this....here goes my quick review in brief about the entire phone specs! 3 years with iPhone 6s and never faced a lag or hang . Battery started draining faster obviously 3 years and heavy usage did that . It is very sad to say that Amazone allow to seller to sell the Damage iPhone to their site,.I purchase iphone XR but after receiving it is found that speaker was not good,vibration problem and camera quality was bad.I contacted to Amazone customer care but they refuse to do the same.î, Amazone customer told  that everything ll be look by iPhone care.I went there and they told me to submit the phone.They r not Exchanging  the same.Its been feel like I m using 2nd hand phone.Really very disappointed. Itís good to be back with Apple and IOS!! It is my first iphone ..i had also read a review about this phone which made me convinced to buy this particular product and model,though color yellow is my own choice,actually I wanted to buy iPhone 11 but when I read a review about this phone i got convinced bcoz sometimes it is really difficult to decide between to best things. Guys whosoever wants to buy iPhone 10 xr plz go for it it is a beautiful phone with all latest feature. Picture quality, screen touch, face recognition,battery life every thing is perfect,And trust me you will not regret..!!??. Great deal.. Got it for 42999 for 128 GB version Pros: I had s4 and SE...bought this because it is from apple..I am not a techie.. now I like SE I received the phone on 21.10.2019, the phone operation was fine till 23.10.2019 and from next day it showed NO SIM after that all other sims were tried but the phone always displayed no sim installed and never worked again, this is the first time I had such a bad experience with Amazon, I was very very upset and today handed over the I phone Xr 128 GB to the authorised service centre in Kolkata, their response was not very positive and they will give feedback in 4-6 days time. Fantastic Apple phone in this price range. It is genuine and good phone. Esim facility is not working. May have to check with the service provider as well. The name Apple defines everything. Awesome phone. The delivery was on time thanks to Amazon. Good battery life and attractive design,  amazon offered great discount so went for it,  little heavy but that is OK.  Overall very nice product Thanks for Amazon for genuine product and safe delivery. Couple of month back i bought this mobile for 55,999. I am quite shock to see the reduction in price. However, The mobile works absolutely fine and truely a flagship phone. Smooth UI, Outstanding camera and average battery life. Delivered with in 2 days, Thanks to Amazon Prime. Best iphone out there coming from iphone 6 , XR just blown my mind away . Below are pros n cons of the phone Phone not working. Phone was autotyping and then eventually frozen screen. I bought on 15th oct and barely used for few days. No support from amazon for replacement for defective piece. One thing to note that when I received this piece, it was in a locked bag. However, there should have been some QR code on bag which the delivery boy scans. There was no such code on the bag and the delivery center sent the qr code as whatsapp on my phone. Indeed a great phone. After a month usage I can say following: While on call, if you want to see the screen, it takes time to turn on. So if you want to disconnect or add another call, frst you have to wait for the screen to turn on.. which is very irritating. One canít even press the home button as it is not there in xr. Even aftr pressing power key, screen doesnít turn on immediately nd pressing it twice results in disconnection of call. ???? Thank you amazon for letting me hv this phone for under 40k. Everything about the phone is exceptional and for a change battery is excellent. Camera is good too and with dual sim capabilities the phone is sure a winner. The 11 is the same phone with just dual camera but 20k higher. So it didnít make sense to buy the iPhone 11. iOS 13 is a failed attempt from apple. The phone does not have a smooth wifi or network connectivity. Its worse than some other phones half the cost. Absolute disappointment. Even older phones like 5s and 6s do not show network issues while the iPhone XR has these issues. Apple support is clueless and cannot solve the issue. Disappointed with this apple product. All else is good just that the phones connectivity which is the most important thing for a phone is atrocious. Avoid if you can. Iím very happy with this Apple product except call records. I didnít find any app that suits my iOS XR in the store, rest everything works well. Everything on this XR works extremely well but the only problem that i have faced is that there is some kind of manufacturing defect in the camera lens.The photos shot have a black spot kind of smoky.Its only visible when something bright like sky or white wall is shot.Also,Iíve wiped the camera glass many times so itís not on the camera but the inside lens.Guys,phone is quite good just be careful while purchasing can happen with anyone. I have been using iPhone XR for about a week and I am impressed with the purchase and the phone has met my expectations. Here are some of the facts: For: Great battery life for an iPhone Pros - good screen resolution, camera quality, battery back up is good. Good screen size. I purchased this phone (Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black) during the Amazone Deewali sale, working fine and no issues so far. Installation and configuration was pretty easy as my previous phone was also iphone. I have checked and verified the product and it is a genuine one. The convenience part  is copying contacts, photos , audio & video files took less than 2 min. In overall,  phone is  good and i got it for around 50K with a Credit card refund offer of 2.5k back after 3 months. But I didnít receive the refund so far. Spoke to bank and they advised to get in touch with Amazon. Not sure where to reach now. I was a bit skeptical about buying it on Amazon. But happy to say..No regrets at all on this purchase. Works exactly as advertised. Absolutely no issues at all. Great battery life, nice photos. While the other variants of the latest iPhone have oled screen, this one has an lcd screen. But I do not think it is making a difference to me. The screen quality is excellent. Overall very satisfied with this purchase. First time iOS user. Shifted from android to iOS finally Reviewing the device after a months of usage. Battery life 5 hour and heating too much...Amazon se na kharide phone Sayed discount ke Naam pe refurbished phone dete hain....iPhone me heating problem samanya nahi hain....mera phone change kardo amazonwale Nice phone got it for rs44000 after discount.with no cost emi from Amazon icici credit card. Red is beautiful. Battery back is good last for more than one day in my case. Performance, quality And finish awesome. Got update to iOS13. Amazon super fast delivery in 14hrs. Phone was covered with innovative tamper proof packaging and a code ,otp was provided to me by sms before delivery. Code to me matched with code on packaging. There is no fingerprint sensor as its Iphone X series..face lock works good even in dark. Display is good fully visible in outdoors. Nice battery backup. Dual sim makes it awsome i.e one E Sim and normal one. May pay nominal fee for esim to operator. Currently only Jio and Airtel support esim..so please consider that. I received this product with slight scratch on the camera edges. It can be easily noticeable and My 1st iPhone. I liked it. Only difficulty I find is I didnít get much variety Of cases and cover for this model. You have to use for hands to handle this phone because of its size and skin. I purchased it in sell at Rs 46k in Nov 19. I prefer volume keys to be in right hand side and music aux cable on top which makes a mobile easy to handle and operate I had purchased the Mobile for Gift to My Son. When I started it on 23rd Oct I found that the some of the functions of the Mobile are not working. To my disapointment I could not return as it was not showing the option. The return period was valid but could not return. I bought a Product Red iPhone XR in the Great Indian Amazon sale in exchange for my 3 year old iPhone 7. I got the 128 GB version for ? 40k. Best value for money apple device right now got this iphone xr for 38k steal price totally worth it i am not an apple fanboy i use my oneplus 7 along with this device the softare smoothness is unmatchable camera is great and brand value is superb but main cons is slow charger it takes almost 3hr to complete the charge and display is also good but flat/accurate colours but i like the saturated one of my 1+ 7 but the quality is very nice closer to 1080 full hd panel for so under 45k is the best apple device you can get but if display is your main priority than oneplus 7t is a better overall device along with fast charging in this price range I checked the IMEI with Apple once i got the phone and it is genuine Hi, i have purchased this phone on 27th sep,  as i am prime member so i got this product on 30th september  I have created apple i. D pass word..  Since morning the very next day of product received..  Today is 1st oct 2019.. In a single day..  Even not completing 24 hours..  It is getting hang..  And it took time to almost 4 hours to unlock my device..  Even though i was not able to unlock my screen I have been using this Phone for about 5 months. I had used 5s and 6s plus. This phone is definitely a Big Big upgrade from former models. Itís brilliant in every possible way. The two main concerns which I had earlier with iPhones were battery life and secondary SIM card. Iím happy that finally Apple heard us and released this beast. You might wonder about thick bezels and LCD display on this phone. I bet you donít notice them at all when you get along with this phone. No wonder why XR is the best selling smartphone worldwide. Battery life is excellent. Enough of reviews. Just go for it. You wonít regret at any point of time! A superb smartphone at this price range, bought k20 pro a few days back but wanted to get an iPhone, got it on the early prime member sale at an amazing price, everything is perfect, except for the camera which shows a yellowish pictures everytime rest of all battery, screen performance is what I needed the most and this didnít let me down. Thanks amazon and apple for timely delivery and a best product †Everything is awesome except battery. This does not seem to be a genuine product. My phone goes completely silent many times and i have to restart it. The seller is not genuine. Better go for other sellers or offline. Really super experience,simply best quality,since 10 eyrs I used android and now feeling ios and iPhone quality,before I used Samsung S9plus which bought for 65k now itís awailable for 28k means 25k worth product they sold for 65k.So my final  openion is shift to ios and iphone xr is value for money. Best battery life amongst current iPhones...lightning fast with the most current A12 processor...specs are almost at par with the iPhone XS/XS Max...except for the camera and display. All in all...excellent price/value equation. I purchase in amazon festive sale at 40000 which is great but if one buy under 50000 at that price also it is amazing I am regular Amazon buyer for many years now.Got my first iPhone xr delivered on 7/10/2019.But sorry to inform it stopped working from 21/10/2019.Amazon delivered Apple phone which is a most trusted brand in world.Do Not know whose fault it is.I contacted Apple authorised service centre ie. Icare  who has d mobile to Bangalore.And now I am waiting for their reply.My trust on Amazon is affected Product is good what we bought from Apple store but what Amazon delivered is not good  I suspect this not good quality product Amazon delivered during sale  with in a month one day this iPhone abruptly went off ND I was not able to on it again Very beautiful phone...very long battery life, superb camera quality...thanks a lot Amazon for such great discount during prime day sale n for making it affordable ...very happy with my purchase?????? The phone is a little big and handling it single handed might be a problem but size matters ! The display and the face recognition is awesome Still now doing great . iPhone XR is a great phone , upgraded from iPhone 8+ , n i am totally satisfied. Yellow is a beautiful colour but the only con is the side bezels n aluminium frame colour. Good battery backup so far. Little bit heavy compared to my previous version. Face unlock feature is a bit irritating sometimes as it gets unlocked sometimes when you donít want to do it Well Iím writing this review after 3months of usage. Writing this review after 1 week of usage. Purchased the 128 GB version during the freedom sale for 57k. I was confused between One plus 7 Pro, IPhone XS and the XR and I must admit that it turned out to be a good decision. Its a classy product and feels premium in hand compared to other devices in this price range. The features that the other phones boast about are hardly being used in day to day life unless you are an avid gamer. The screen size is just perfect and quality is not bad as being highlighted in some of the reviews on youtube. Battery life is excellent, camera is very good and the phone is waterproof. Performance is excellent with A12 Bionic processor. I used to be an apple hater but no other phone ever matches the gaming optimisation of the iPhone XR/XS/XS Max. These devices with the A12 bionic chip just beat any other android devices in graphics rendering performance without a doubt. People have been complaining about the display that is basically 828p but trust me, you wonít even notice the difference between a proper 1080p screen and this one. In fact this screen looks better than most of the 1080p mobile phone screens (thanks to the liquid retina display technology it uses). The camera is amazing in all aspects and one of the best out there in the smartphone market but it canít click portraits without detecting a human face (P.S. you can download an app named halide at the appstore to click non human portraits). After 2 weeks of usages I am giving my review: Very good phone but can be priced better as this can be considered as low in value for money otherwise Best budget phone from Apple with better image stabilisation similar to iPhone XS. Battery life is extremely competitive with one plus battery\\'s lifetime. One of the best iPhone ever. Features are fabulous and battery life is excellent. On an average it lasts up to 10 hrs if you are an extensive phone user. This includes data usage and voice calling.  Bit heavy I comparison to other iPhones or android phones but might be thatís the trick itís good on battery life. Iíll give 10/10 The camera quality is not as good as I excepted it to be. It forms grams in the captures which is very evident when the pictures are projected on a monitor or a tv screen. Battery life is superb, goes more than 36 hours with normal usage until it hits the 20% low. Face recognition is perfect. Everything else is quite well except battery consumption which does not lie with the promised service that is upto 25 hrs of talktime (wireless) and upto 16 hrs of video streaming (wireless), at all. Hi, The device is good as it has everything what people look for in this price segment, i have used both i11 and XR , 11 is best because it has new processor rest XR is also a good option. I have received this product  on 1 Jul 2019, Since then i am experiencing difficulty with wi-fi Connections (taking some time to connect, not connecting spontaneously, not detecting other Wi-fi connections). Face ID not working properly (taking time to detect).  I was thinking Amazon sold the one of the damaged product. Very  bad experience with such a costly mobile ordered in Amazone Got.the product today, heating up very fast , and also not connecting to Android and other equipment. Not performing when trying to upload to cloud, etc. Connectivity issues.  Amazon says no refund , am in the.process of cancelling other buy orders. Was using X 64gb from last 2 yrs, apart from OLED display things are pretty much the same Awesome... iPhone XR is brilliant perfect value for money phone giving all the specs of latest iPhone in a reasonable price. Packs the same display, screen & pixel density as iPhone 11 only difference being camera upgrade & A 13 bionic processor rest almost everything is same. Excellent battery life, display in iPhone XR. The White Colour looks simple, sober & classy unlike dull creamy white in XS or XS Max last year. All in all a very good phone & thoroughly satisfied with it. This phone really feature-rich. Terrific Purchase. Initially there was a heating issue while updating software but it has gone now and working excellent. Coming from iphone 8, i really did not need this upgrade..but believe it or not..i am flattered..got a stellar deal of 40k for 128GB..camera is good from iphone 8..overall still it cannot beat my other beast Samsung Galaxy S10 plus..but here is the cliche..an iphone is an iphone. I was worried that it will be little oversized with 6.1 inch but fits well . Battery backup is good one full charge keeps it running for 1.5 days . Not tested camera yet . Got it in very good deal at 46k . Blue colour looks good. Third class screen and resolution, Very poor outdoor visiblity, network issue with dual sim, wifi drop/speed issue, slow data/ltr issue...slow charger included which takes ages for full charge... I am writing review after two months of usage. Great battery life. We are getting a battery life of almost upto 2 days now. I was skeptical at first. Some people mentioned that they received fake of defective products. In my case, the product is genuine. I checked itís serial number on Apple website too. There is no difference in performance compared to people who bought from stores. What do I say about it. Night vision of camera is not at all good. Battery literally gets drain if we use mobile data for longer time. Yes but I have to admit if we do not use mobile data or wifi battery life is longer. Face recognition is not as fast as I was thinking compare to other brands with same features. But I loved my iPhone regardless of all this little issues. All the performance is good with all working features. and the main point was the battery backup of the phone it will minimun 1 and 1/2 day and another amazing think is i got no heating in this phone while i playing games like pubg mobile,cwc2 etc.Also a measure think is there is no comparison of ios with android. IOS is best in his performance. Overall its a good product, battery backup is little bit good compared to other iphone models.., Camera is Okay but i have seen mostly noise in the photos.Sound quality is as usual awesome, and I didnít tried underwater test but tried splash test, itís  up to the mark upon splash proof....I am using it since last 3 months I didnít face any problem...Go 4 It???? Switched to iPhone XR from MI A2 Amazon people are least bothered after giving a defective product.Such a costly product and i wonder how they can give such a defective Apple product and the customer has to run around with that.Amazon will ask to contact Apple support center and submit it there. and if you contact Apple customer care they will ask to contact Amazon. it just goes around like that.After submitting to Apple now amazon people are relectuent to take it back... its been 5 days without any solution...Please do not buy iphones from Amazon...Worst experience... Its been one week since i bought it. I am completely satisfied with the product. Screen is quite big. Only and only problem is with the Charger. It takes 3 hours to charge the phone to 100%. Otherwise everything else is worth the price we are paying. I bought this iPhone XR in the Great Indian Sale from Amazon. Product was perfectly delivered and on time. Buying from amazon is safe and you get genuine products always. Guys i wud suggest you all to not buy the phone from the site as the one I have received is nt in its best condition..itís sensor is nt working properly n it hangs too at times n I have just received the phone just 15 days back I had never used an Iphone before and I was always sceptical about going for an IOS from android but after using this phone all I can say is IOS is on par with android. It is my red beast.... My first iPhone experience with iPhone xr is very smooth and awesome... I got is at only 38K many many thanks to amazon for this. Battery performance is good... with normal usage it gives around 24hrs backup while with heavy usage 12-13 hrs backup you can definitely get. But charging adapter  in the box is very pathetic. I just ordered an 12W fast charger at 1K from amazon. It is a smart choice to get iPhone Xr at 40K over iPhone 11 at 59 K (Including HDFC bank offer). With your saved money you can buy different apple accessories. Overall my first iPhone experience is awesome. This is my first iOS Not even completed 1 yr of this product and price reduced drastically. How you can decrease the price to such extend. I need compensation for that, amazon shall take necessary actions on it. got this for a superb deal, in fact way cheaper than mu prev 7plus which i got back in late 2016. Face ID works like a charm and the display seems great for normal usage. After 5 days of use,Love the IPhone XR Red ,Premium Top Class Phone,Got it For 38 k...Worth it...Camera Is Classy and Superb...With depth Control feature....Very Smooth...Display is good...Bit Battery is little low but compared with other iPhone it is good....Battery Standby is 10 hr when onscreen time is 8h 30m with always Data on with usage of FB ,YouTube and other apps. Face Unlock is so quick..Over all love to have this IPhone XR...Upgraded from IPhone SE to XR...So Battery is very much better for me...?????? This is my first apple product purchase, prior my mentality regarding the apple product was like a no Value for money company, but once I started using this phone the premium fell and the Sooth buttery flow type interface is way better than android. Happy to use this phone. Great phone. Not a gamer so donít care about the hardware stuff. Not a pro photographer so any pictures I shoot are epic for me. Not a loud person, so speakers on low volume for me work just perfectly. Battery life should be great like most apple phones do. Display is soft to my eyes so I like that. Apple interface is the best, so nothing much to say about there. Used for a day as of now. Awesome phone. Snappy and fluid in use. battery backup is pretty good (around 8 hours of screen-on time) with continouse data-on (youtube 1.5 hrs). Using 18W adapter which charges it fast. Brought 3.5mm jack connector to lightening separately. Rest all good. Will review after few more days. Thanks. I do not like the  features of iPhone XR after paying huge amount. It is battery is drained very fast . Side buttons are not comfortable while holding on hands, it pressed automatically without knowing . One-Two times it has automatically dialed the number when it was in my pocket. I think old version of iphones are  much better than this phone. I wants to return this phone but do not find any option in Amazon. Anyone please suggest how I can return it. I bought it 28 days before. There is no fingerprint reader on this phone as its replaced by face recognition which works fine. User interface is same as my earlier iPhone which is excellent. Coming to battery life...it is simply amazing. Second time I shifted to Apple . But this time it was from One Plus 5T . Speed wise, battery wise, photo and video quality wise , fast charging , everything One Plus was better .  XR hangs also sometimes while receiving calls . But it was never the case with One plus . I received in original iPhone sealed package.  For its price, its best possible iPhone in market. Look and feel is great. Very fast responsive while using. Camera quality is 5-Star, Portrait pics are crisp clear. Watched some 4k and HDR videos on this iPhone, stunningly beautiful with tru color and deep contrast on this display. Its Amazing iphone, Thanks Amazon. This item is faulty. Make a sure first . Using this phone since last 20 days...first time iOS user...spending this much money not worth i have purchased @ 43000.00.purchased it because i have not used apple before...those who r buying it just because of Apple logo..pl do not go..those who r enthusiastic for technology must go for it...i m a simple user not very technical not very camera oriented...a simple redmi user..i m not saying phone is bad but doe those who do not have much usage with regards to its unique features should avoid this... Amazing What is the main purpose of the Phone? To make and receive calls, right. This phone has a defective microphone so call quality is damn poor. You have to speak very close to the microphone for the other person to hear you. All other feature works quite well. As for photos, even Poco F1 takes better pictures. Applez just a brand as was Nokia and Blackberry once. After using one month best camera and battery backup. I browsed a lot about this phone all were saying it has a LCD display and which is older. Serious problem with the lower mic, after spending all that money in this faulty crap just after two months you finally feel that you are the biggest C* in India who is buying an iPhone. Fragile product, connectivity issue, software issue & restrictions  all the type of minor issues have been build up causing a serious issue. Think before you waste ya hard earned money. Apple products are degrading their quality to keep their stocks and shares up. Good deal and worth buying for iPhone customers non iPhone user please do not buy as you will not find worthy but as a premium product its very good and feels better in hand superb quality Bought it In white 64gb variant...looks are premium and has a large screen...being an lcd screen it far much better than other phones in competition...you get about 56gb of usable storage which is quite ok for a minimal user...performance is amazing and camera quality is average...must buy if you are looking for a budget iphone specially on offers Well Apple products deliver quality and apple I phone xr is just another fine product I bought few days back which is their lowest model in iPhone x series. Well for the specs and lcd screen I really feel it is over priced that is reason it gets one star less. Happy with the phone, initially I was scared to buy as it is expensive, and reviews were making me go on doubt, but the product came in a good condition,phone is superb. Thank you amazon for fast reliable service I am giving this review after few months of use of this phone. Apple never disappoints you. As i have shifted from Google phone to Apple, was bit difficult to shift from android to ios but now i am used to it. So many hidden features which you can find it out from you tube. Camera is awesome. I also learned some extra tips for photography from youtube and it is awesome. The speed of the phone never disappoints you after loading full 64gb data into the phone. Overall phone is awesome. Itís as good as buying from the store. The plastic cover which covers the box had a cut and small piece missing . Due to bad handling may be . That was disappointing to see. But then again the box was all sealed and itís ok . Nothing to complain I was more satisfied with my one plus 6T than this. Picture customization is not better than that phone. Without comparison it is ok. Battery life is good than other iPhones and the app size in store is very less compared to play store so even with 64 gb it is good. This product is not adequate in terms of its quality & performance. Itís screen creates problems in eyes i.e. not comfortable for eyes. Very very bad product. Totally disappointing. Very very bad item delivered by Amazon. Heat problem is there with my iPhone XR. Amazon Sells fake iPhones. Not satisfied at all. This iPhone has also hanging problem. I like the XR. This review is more for people who have yet to graduate to buying mobiles etc online. This was my first time. I had heard all sorts of stuff. But Amazon THANK YOU! Delivered in a tamper proof packing! With the assurance of a ten day window to return. The phone is working just fine! The accessories and the packing not at all good. I have used apple products, earlier packing and accessories are very good quality. Seems apple degraded the quality may be they have ordered from China. Not matching the standard of apple. Very bad experience in this iPhone XR. There are so many issues in this phone like when I click on airdrop icon then phone freezes and I have to force restart to get it working. Quality at its best . You buy it and if you want QUALITY, with best user friendly interface and camera . List goes on . Its the best . Thatís why you are here . Donít think again and again . Click buy . You will not regret and yes you want it. ?????? Excellent choice from iPhone family , only sad they drop the price around 10k 2 months after my purchase. I missed the chance, lucky new customers. I used it for 1 month. I am very happy to this i phone xr mobile. Very good and very comfortable mobile for good battery health goood camera and good Processor proformence. No any mobile Completed to i phone . Very good privacy and ezy to use you must by This is my first iPhone. Though itís too early to give any review about the phone  as I bought it recently but  till now Iím very impressed with iPhone XR. Go for it. Well, it has been more than 2 months now and the phone has been getting compliments. It is the first iPhone that I have bought and I should say that the money you are paying for the phone is mostly for the brand image. Cannot believe I got this phone for Rs 36,000 I have bought it around a month back. Used it and then writing a review. 3D camera not working .. cannot setup faceid .. always displaying Face ID not available error neither front camera portrait working .. please help donít have a clue where to go for help The most positive aspect of XR is battery life in my usage of 6 months. Downside is weight especially if you are upgrading from iPhone 6 or 7. Quite heavy due to big battery. Make sure you upgrade to iOS 13 and use the feature to optimise battery charging for longevity of battery I upgraded from iPhone 6 which I had used for 2.5 years. For me iPhone XR seems super smooth with amazing speed. I am still getting used to the absence of Home button. Using the regular charger, the phone takes nearly 2 hours to fully charge but charge lasts for more than 1 day for my regular usage. Phone is slippery - so I have added a Spigen case as well. On the whole a good iphone. Amazing product, fell in love with IPhone.In short I can tell this product is dam equal to premium 48-64 mega pixel camera phones in market,even bit more.I got it for all time low price 38000/- Flawless product, really good product thanks Amazon received the perfect without any default or any. Mobile performance is awesome as I have upgraded from iPhone 6s to Xr feeling great and enjoying the new features face unlock and others. Face unlocking is very fast and quick compare to other android phone 5 ?? from my side?????? The product was intact. Great packaging. The phone feels amazing. Itís my first time using an iPhone and I really think the XR is worth it if you want an iPhone that doesnít burn a deep hole in your pocket. Itís my first iPhone and I am totally happy with it. One thing that iPhone XR is having a best battery backup. And I love the performance. I was having a Redmi Note 4 device previously. It was having a 4 GB ram but itís performance was not up to the mark. I am surprised how iPhone is handling this kind of performance in only 3 GB of RAM ?? Not happy with battery life. Rest everything Is fine. Just loving the XR and is super value for money. Camera quality is really good and screen size is just perfect for watching videos and doesnít look bulky at all. Only downside is that the Apple logo at the back on the black colour isnít visible to the naked eye so prominently. Best iPhone after the 6s model. Not bulky, not big, this is a perfect sized iPhone. Display is crisp and clear. Smart hdr photos are great. It was a steal deal for me at Rs. 37999 during special sale. Delivered within 22 hours of ordering. Got it for ?37,999 and at this price it is the best phone. Though a little bulky and heavy but itís fine. Camera quality, battery life both are best features of the phone. No fingerprint sensors are drawbacks. Little bit heavy than OnePlus 5T. Never used LCD screen feeling odd for a while but it is worth for money. Built is very strong. iPhone comes with some unnecessary apps I will delete it later. Excellent camera and phone build. There is no finger print reader in this but Face ID is ur answer for all this. Works great and secure. Battery is super better when compared to older iPhones and lasts more then 24 hrs with calls music Bluetooth devices connected and browsing and social media. Pretty satisfied so far. Overall Iphone XR is far better than X and other predecessors. Processor is way fast than others, build quality is awesome ,face recognition is too quick and the feel which you get by holding it is superlike. One suggestion to Apple that they must include fingerprint sensors too for more effective security. Bought it for 49999 on sale and it is totally worth it. I am using iPhone for 1st time and totally in love with it. As iPhone is famous for its camera quality and it is true. Only problem is that it does not have the fingerprint lock. Iíve been using this phone since a week now and i must say its totally worth the money! Just go for it! Device was heating too much after just a little bit of graphic works on that. Camera was too bad , front camera is no where matching the quality of IOS. I was totally disappointed with that device , I think they sold me the defective peice in the name of sale on your platform. This kind of professionalism is not good . I believe too much on Amazon but later on that I am not giving any bulk amount of order on this e commerce platform. Sorry for the comments if it hurts anyone. I bought 2 iPhone XR both are awesome. Canít really say much the phone itself makes a statement. I just loved it and I think the only thing that is lagging in this product which is the oled screen is not an issue at all , the quality of the lcd is way too good and as long as you are not too obsessed with every feature to be the latest and best , go for it , plus now they are offering at a way better price , definitely worth it Camera quality is good. 4/5 stars. Rear camera at night is awesome. It gives the effect of DSLR. Front camera is of average quality, grains when taken photo. But apple camera gives the natural effect to your photos! Itís been about a month using the IPhone XR. Was too enthusiastic about buying this phone. Front camera deteriorating everyday. Front camera quality is supper flop, even worst den any minimum range android phone. Rear camera is also not at per. Face detector not so good. No finger print available hence facing problems most of the time. Overall Apple releases a bad number with this variant. Got this for 38k and received within 2 day of placing order ....Apple FACE ID is the most secure way of unlocking your phone which you would not get on an another phone...camera is also top notch and is the same camera which iphone XS has got  but without the 2nd  telephoto/wide angle lens....overall quite happy with the iphone xr. I upgraded from my iPhone 7 to XR and Iím really happy with the performance looks and all the new features. Battery life is awesome and face recognition works perfectly even in dark. Total value for money and it goes without saying as it is an Apple product. Iím so happy to say, itís an authentic/genuine Apple Product. Will definitely buy again. Amazon actually gives you better discounts than Resellers. Received it yesterday, transferring data from my 7 plus took a couple of hours( maybe because of net issues) but everything on my old phone came on this XR. The camera is truly amazing. Go for it. Excellent device.Value for money. I already have iPhone 11 . I bought this for my friend there is not a single difference when compared to iPhone 11. Phone display,performance,everything same as iPhone 11. Iím pretty much satisfied. Liked display, camera quality, response etc. battery life is not great compared to 5000 mih Android phone. 18 hours from full charge. Itís price dropped to 39000+discounts within 20 days I purchased at 52000. It seemed to be cheated. A huge -ve impact for further purchases. Site as well as apple have to manage all things regarding it otherwise both will lose their credibility. No doubt product is good but these huge fluctuations in price ruined whole prospects of the product Has every thing you might be looking in an iPhone except the oled screen camera is as good as iPhone Xs with few limitations. If display is not a big concern for you you cannot get a better phone than this at this price range. Amazing camera in bright light. Average to poor performance in medium and low light conditions. Great battery. Privacy protection is an understated advantage. The iPhone XR delivers fast performance, great cameras and longer battery life than other flagship phones, all in a colorful and affordable package. Everything is well checked and warranty looks legitimate. Absolutely genuine product without any doubt. Bought yellow colour, feels mango in my hand. Getting a worthy case is real challenge though. After Using IPhone 6s & OnePlus 6, IPhone XR 128gb is juz awesome in face recognition battery life & user interface, Compared to IPhone 11 lesser in cost  both are in same size & same 4G ! Such a good iphone for such a great price. Its just a phone with good features, if switching from android you will love using its interface, a pure secure platform and flawless running experience. Excellent product, 100% original! I bought iPhone XR 128gb in the month of October, I was double minded to buy this product as all know online products will never reach us perfectly. But my assumption failed with this product. in one word I forgot android.. lovely phone This phone is a beast. Man,the phones touch response is just awesome and iOS is so buttery smooth. †This is my first apple device in terms of phone. The phone is totally worth it (every penny).  The colour, camera, design, sound quality everything is just way beyond perfection. Got It for 38k. Ditched One plus 7T for this and I am very happy with this decision and ya screen is great but you will feel difference if you are coming from 1440p display else it is great. Great phone camera is good ,battery is good , but it take too much time to charge , company #APPLE need to give fast charger in box. And one more thing the weight of iphone xr is little bit more than other android phone.  Other wise phone is great.......gaming performance is great?? †Just want to say GO FOR IT! I got it for 39,999 in the Amazon Great Indian festival and let me tell you, it arrived within 24 hours. Even though iPhone 11 is here, it has the same exact screen and almost the same features except the camera. If you are a die hard camera fan, then go for iPhone 11. But this works for me :) Do not buy iPhone on amazon The phone which a person need this is one for them. Really loved it everything in this price range bybapple it is very good product. But i m not satisfied with its display. Display quality and clearity is very poor 720p video play is not good so blurry THANKS TO AMAZON GOT DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AT FIRST FOUND SCRATCHES AND DAMAGE BUT AMAZON ALWAYS THERE TO HELP YOU GOT REPLACED QUICKLY WITHIN FEW DAYS AND GOT A BRAND NEW PRODUCT LIKE TO THANK YOU AMAZON AND SELLER ALSO DARSHITA ELECTRONICS IF YOU ARE THINKING TO BUY IPHONE GO FOR DARSHITA?? camera quality is just awesome and battery backup is soo great that give you a whole day use, smooth interface,in many reviews they said display is of LCD, but when i got my device, then i Relies even that iphone have LCD display but it is great viewing display, I have no regrets to buy that iphone XR. Go for it guys. Nothing to say about iPhone itís always the best phone. But this time i have to thank Amazon for bringing the cost down and affordable during great indian sale which says IRRESISTIBLE DEAL which really is a irresistible deal iPhone XR is Good and I am yet to use all features of the phone, I had used iPhone 5, 6s. Lots new features available . Itís a great phone. Cut some stars as the camera developed a problem after only 6 weeks. But Apple has fixed it. But it was unexpected and Apple and the seller must ensure that these things donít happen The phone conks off, donít think the OS can take load. Been just 2 months and itís already acting up. Not sure if the problem is with the device or orders from amazon. Display 4/5 I always thought to buy iPhone and every time I used to think that what is so special in iPhone but yes after buying iPhone XR I can say that no one can replace this. Starting from battery life to the screen which is standard and can be used one handed. Camera quality is also very good which you can realise after two three clicks only. So for me iPhone XR is a beast at low price among other iPhone models. Camera not that great. ORDER PLACED : 1 October 2019 Pathetic product, everyday reporting new issues and going to hangout every time. No questions about ?? other than its affordability, XR got a price cut and made it affordable. Overall product quality is awesome, only issue is at times its too hitech to understand. Apple ecosystem and almost latest specs for 40k. I purchased this beauty in big billion sale. Thus I got it at a remarkable price. The battery life is good so far and the speed has been pretty good. I love the overall look, size and design of this model a lot. The camera quality is great but definitely the higher version have a better camera quality experience to provide. I am iphone lover but always disappointed with battery back up. But after getting this superb phone my love towards iphone become more stronger. Amazing camera screen clarity, good time response, face unlock takes leasser than eye blink.amazing battery back up. Stunning look. Overall no need to purchase dslr camera. Spend money on it and you get phone for the lifetime. While so far all my iPhones before had a small write up about the licensing etc at the back of the phone. This XR does not have any writing. Phone is excellent...Thanks to Amazon for their service. But the delivery was pathetic, the delivery boy refused to deliver the product. I, myself went to their office to get my phone. Hope that it will not repeat in future. The camera quality in night is awesome..there are lots of features to do edit the pictures and videos. Other than that battery life is around 1.5 days in normal usage and 6-8 hours in heavy games like pubg asphalt videos YouTube play music etc. at the price of 43k itís a steal.... Received my iPhone within a week after place the order, Had issues with it but thanks to amazon for speedy replacement. Using the XR for the past 3 months and Iím completely delighted to have this model. Certainly a value for money product in the iPhone flagship category. Battery life is excellent, charging for one time in a day itself will have enough power for the remaining day. Camera quality is comparatively better than the other high end categories iPhones. Camera is very good .Screen size is just right for people like me who use phone for typing mails to watching Netflix .One can download multiple apps .Speed is good .Face recognition works like magic .Have been using iPhone since last 5 yrs ,and have found no reason to complain so far. It is one of the best phones available in the market right now. Apple always gives the best products to its customers. It had A12 chipset which can do 5 trillion operations per second. It never slows down. It gives you the best phone using experience. Go for it, if you can buy it. Do not buy Samsung products or OnePlus products they are just useless. Just go for the product. Review after 5 months of usage approximately. #1mobile of the my devices First of all I thank Amazon for such blazing fast delivery and the packaging was terrific. So trustworthy. Secondly Apple gets full marks for such a master piece. iPhone XR is capable of handling my heavy multitasking efficiently. So far so good. Reviewed after using it for almost a day. Thanks Amazon and Apple Superb phone. Got it at a price of 39999/- on Big Billion Day Sale Original product at the best price.... got it during great Indian festival sale at an amazing discount.. so far after a few days of use must say itís an obvious and noticeable upgrade for people using iPhone 7 and beyond .. camera quality is quite good if not the best ...battery life is just awesome ... I ordered it for my wife as she wanted to use IPhone for so long but was not willing to change her phone. could not find fingerprint reader. Otherwise camera and battery life are good. I like live camera in edit mode in camera. I have purchased this product during the diwali sale on Oct 22 and now the adaptor does not work. A product worth 43k having an adaptor life of 22 days... I do not even know what else to do now. Removed the sim and started using old broken phone since morning I am using iPhone from last 8 years. This model no need to carry power bank(for me) compared with iPhone 6s and 7 People who say iPhone XR has inferior display, please use before you judge based on specs. Iíve been using Pixel and recently switched to iPhone XR and I loved it. Battery life is unrivalled and Fave ID is charm. 5 star quality... 1st apple product for my wife and in the family, Very good phone, clear crisp sound quality, Amazing display ... Apple does not compromise with it is product. Highly recommended. This rating is not for the product.... Its for the seller... Who has delivered the product with scratches on the back panel..... Nice products battery life is very good. Camera is ok. Amazon delivery is wrost as i have to ordered it twice. In between i suffer loss of 2500 rs as price has been increased after best discount period has gone. I am so happy with amazon.!! Good price and get it on time and yes perfect original product..!! Iphone XR 64 gb  if you allrdy using iphone than you will love it and you buying is first time than you wll flll in love for sure ..!!! I am giving this review after using my iphone XR for more than month..!! So trust me guys its good and original product.!!! I just loved it! Brother just bought iPhone 11 and I thinks the XR battery life is better than 11 and 11 has heating problem. I loved the phone its fast fast and very fast with fabulous camera Not happy with the mobile , let me know if you guys can send new mobile or can give a option to upgrade to iphone 11 . Let me know what best can be done . The first thing you notice about XR is itís battery. Super long battery of more than 24 hours. Rest is exactly as it should be in an iPhone. Camera also needs a special mention. Great camera. Does what it is supposed to do. True iPhone, no exceptions. Gud phone ...camera is super.. iPhone XR does not have finger print reader as itís unlocked with face reading.. My infact upgraded from my iPhone 7 to XR. Itís been more than a month I am using it and has no issues. Amazon had the best rate and it is during the Flash sale , I picked it up at 49,999/-.  Their delivery was prompt and was prior to the committed date. My IPhone XR has a fantastic camera, a fast processor, exceptional battery life and high quality display. There is nothing much to say specially about iPhone. I have used several android devices and I switched to iPhone XR from OnePlus 6. Simply this switching is fabulous experience to me. Got it for 39000 in the great Indian sale along with exchange (redmi 4) and using SBI credit card. Anawesome phone. Once we use iPhone, android phones seem cheap. You start appreciating little details that Apple has done to make this phone worth its price and hype. If you can afford, then close your eyes and bye it. You will not be disappointed The box was not sealed and looked re-packed. I have used iPhone since so many years Got this phone at a discount price in amazon. Slightly heavy but good looking phone with terrific battery life. The phone is fast with a very responsive face detection. Genuine product received from seller Darshita Electronics.Everything is fine after 7days of use.One thing is the set getting heat whenever large file is being downloaded or playing game.Rest everything is just cool.Iím loving it. Awesome phone, great battery life it can last upto 2 whole days, face ID works great even if you are in dark room. Screen size perfect so that we can do tasks using single hand. Will get long term support. 5w charging adapter works well but it is good to have 12w charger than 5w. Feel big for iPhone 7,8,6 users. I love iPhone XR very much. It is user friendly, top notch though there are compromises compared to the other models especially the flagship ones. Overall, it is a highly recommended phone for all the Apple fans and iPhone lovers. Thank you Apple!! Make sure you read all instructions, check package and then give OTP. the phone was brand new and is working great. had reservations about online delivery but this experience was seamless. Good to get this discount at discount. Excellent product.........iphone XR is jet fast. loving it. Awesom, getting 1day full and few hrs more. 3hrs of Pubg, 2hrs of skype meeting, calls msgs, songs, internet. Finally iPhone had worked on battery. This is all from normal mode.  Pow power  mode is even better. Do Not go by the reviews that mention fake product !! Its very much iphone xr that i ordered !! How the phone is would b a very personal view point but itís definitely not a fake !! Thank god i went by my instincts and got a great deal Super smooth and premium product nice camera good battery life quick face unlock even in dark. Plays heavy games with high graphic settings without any lag. Overall a very good product There is a problem of signal. It is frequently going, where as other make mobiles are having good signal. Now the voice of video has also become very low. Not a good buy.  Can any guide where to report the issue. I like everything about this product. I ordered this iphone xr on end of festive sale and Amazon delivered the product in the given time period. Everything in this phone works good and fine , no doubts. Amazon gives 100% product to us, they never unsatisfied me. At the end Product\\'s performance outstanding . Amazon delivery also secure??. Really really good product..if you have budget of 50-60k you should definitely go for iphone XR..excellent batterylist last of 1 and half day..brilliant camera and superb portrait mode !! I Have purchased in 52k in amazon sale..it is surely value for money !! I like this phone. I got iphoneXR at very reasonable price. The apple company has made one thing better in this model i.e. battery life. The phone runs for 2days with full charge. there is no finger print reader in this model although face id is very accurate, it scans your face even in the dark. There is no doubt about the picture quality when it comes to iphone. I am big Apple fan from almost decade ??and they have never disappointed either on the hardware side or the iOS( operating system). Got this from amazon deal at very attractive price It is really a good one by apple. Easy to use and very fast processor. I just love it... and big advantage is it supports dual sim but now the price has been dropped to 54990 by apple in india Ya really super phone/theyíre confusing to(AirPods &Earpods) this phone with EarPods with lightening connector only not for Bluetooth AirPod ur clearly understand then you will pay I switched from Android to iOS through this and so far it is been amazing, the battery goes 1.5 day with heavy use, camera\\'s awesome and the new iOS 13 gives all the features that you need. They gave me a faulty phone which i came to knew after one month, The product is excellent. Nice phone. Worth buying for the price. Only regret is the price went down by 3000 rupees within one day. I have not yet opened as the outer cover seems damaged After using it for 6 days properly . The phone started to hang it automatically restarts and gets stuck on apple log had to format my phone 2 time. Apple service center could not detect the problem . THEY Said it should be sent to bangalore for repair due to some motherboard issue . So i dnt want all that headache i want my phone replaced by a new sealed pack same iphone No lesser than iPhone XS Max At Rs 35,000 (big billion sale + exchange offer), its a steal. For phone review, go to google - there are plenty of XR reviews. As good as it gets What a phone . Display is not a concern ,it is brilliant even it is 720p.build is excellent . It is a very pretty and good looking mobile. Performance wise, it is super smooth. Camera is as good as iPhone XS, portrait mode is also good enough.  And the best part is, being an iphone it has a long lasting battery. Though it has LCD, but you would hardly be able to find any difference between this and OLED. Size is perfect, infact everything is perfect and cool! The phone is definitely not performing per iPhone standards - frequent Call drops ( the issue is not with network provider ) and battery life is worse than iPhone 8. Back glass of Iphone got broken after one month of buying without any prior incident. Disappointed with the service provided by Amazon. If something happens to our product, Amazon will be saying to contact Manufacturer. Face ID is very very slow. There seems to be a problem with the microphone. There is an issue with the sensors. Microphone issues, touch issues. Iíve been trying to raise a complaint but the amazon support team is always redirecting me to the apple website. Iíve been unable to return this item since Iíve discovered the problems. I really need assistance on this matter. Great phone = great battery life + great camera especially in low light + great security and face recognition. Very happy and bought it at the right time before the prices went up again. Like the luk and fallen in love on firstsight. Feel great when unlookers give an appreciative glance. Invaluable asset. In portrait Camera - while taking a photo of a substance or anything (other than people)it always says ëperson not detectedí. portrait function is only for people , not for the object. What to say itís Apple amazing man but when youíre buying this mobile better you should buy a CaseAlong with it because the backside of mobile is slippery and made of plastic plus glass,,Worth to buy it This is the best product from apple till date. I just love it.it has got all I want.good camera decent battery life good sound etc etc.and the display do not give me any problems.if there is something to complain about it is the price. Superb smartphone. Certain features of Apple makes it completely class apart. Great battery backup, extraordinary camera quality, support of dual sim etc segregate it from the other brands. Best value for money in iphone . I am extremely satisfied with the purchase with no worry for storage for this 256 GB model. Wireless charging is just wow. Its a perfect phone, though a bit heavy coz of the metal body. I got this in red colour which is my favourite and its such a settled red, basically its a mixture of red and maroon. Camera quality is also good not the best as compare to other apple phones. Overall i love my phone as its a gift from my darling husband. Timely delivered. Gr8 deal from amazon. Few months back I ordered one plus mobile from same seller. They delivered original product. Simply love XR! Battery life is great and Iím not really missing the telephoto lens! Do buy product red as it support AIDS Research. The product is working fine. Just as expected from apple product. However there were two scratch marks on the sides of the phone just after unboxing which is very strange Itís always a charm to use iPhone. Ease of use and fast response are key. This phone is hanging n seller is not returning or changing this phone I tried many times but I have been an apple patron for a while.. I Started using the Iphone 3, 5, 6, 7 and now i bought the XR.. I honestly feel that its terrible.. Just a hype build around it.. The Face ID never works, the camera gets stuck on its portrait mode.. My honest feedback is not to but the iPhones anymore. Just will have to say that Apple lost itself a good customer.. Excellent phone I am happy I suggest you all to buy with amazon, because maintaining genuine sellers with good quality products and the biggest most important  thing is  customers support I am very much happy with amazon and their customers support. Hats off I bought a new iPhone XR from amazon and the delivery was within 24 hours. It was a brand new pack sealed. While I started using this phone, I realized that my takes much longer time to get charged. However, other phones I have get charged quickly from their respective cables. I am unsure about the originality of the product received. Not a value for money product.Apple is still giving 1amp charger with such expensive phone with almost 3000 mAh battery. The same charger is also  given along with 5s and also SE. Bought this cell phone for my retired father. He is a person who wanted a great battery life, good camera and great speakers with ease of use that is not present in any android cell phone in the market. I have got the product in one piece thatís true but this product is defected one. Out of two speakers one is damaged. I am regulars IPhone user since from past 5 years and thatís why I could point it out. Amazon - kindly notice The battery is not a 4000 mah  like many other phones these but still has a lot of life in it . This is my second IPHONE and the performance just outclasses any android phone Excellent-The best we can purchase with small amounts purchased for 42999/- at offer from amazon Osome product but I suggest get iPhone 11 updated version of iPhone XR. Beautiful phone. Great camera. I just feel that the phone gets heated a bit I guess I am not sure though as itís my first day on this phone and have been constantly playing online games Value of money is excellent but little costly evrything is good.problem compared with mi poco f1 Rs15000.waste of money.. I love apple products, have been using them since 2009 and this is the finest iPhone Iíve ever used. I received my order yesterday and the voice recorder is defective, have spoken to apple support, after troubleshooting they recommended I get it checked at an authorised service centre as it seems to be a defected piece. I bought this phone on Big billion day. It was well packed and the phone is very good. Battery quality and camera quality is  amazing. Those who do not buy yet and thinking for it, go for it, it will not disappoint you. Size is bit over, good battery life than previous products. If you were using iPhone 6,6s or 7 might find it bigger to hold because itís size is 6.1 which quite big for iPhone if you never used plus editions. Faulty charging cable it charges phone only from one side. When buying online check every aspect before actually using it The phone I received was defective. Please think twice about buying apple products as I faced the same issue with my MacBook Air. There is no solution provided by Amazon which was surprising as they use to have very good customer care. I feel I have wasted my money. The processor is not that speed as expected. Just received the phone and checked for the warranty on apple site. Itís showing that purchase is not validated...after 4 hours again I checked. And smile on my face. Apple said your purchase is validated and warranty Amazon is sending defective devices, please donít purchase. Best phone for those users who really need a very good battery life. Camera supreb and video stabilization is just fabulous. Go for it ????  A bit bulky feels like you r carrying a mini RDX ???? I personally like Apple product. But my charger is not as good as it shout be like an apple product. After a moth of using my charger stopped working. Overall the phone rates 4/5 considering the price of 49k for a128 GB. Camera quality is gud but just has the basic features and no advanced techs like the ones in oppo /Mi .Battery is gud .It will sustain a day for me (I donít play games).Call function is what worries me in this phone.It gets stuck all of a sudden while attempting a call. First off all I would like say, the delivery boy of amazon is very polite with consumers. Faceid not functioning after 15 days.phone freezes once selfie portrait mode is activated.Face it does not work anymore now Android no match to iOS. A gift for spouse, a bit on bulky side but an effective gadget I have been using this phone for almost a month a now and this is the fastest smartphone I have ever used. I know this years iPhone 11 is faster than this but after watching a tons of comparison videos on YouTube I have decided to go with the XR. I do not think it is worth the extra bucks and I am very satisfied with this purchase. Amazing smartphone with best build auality and camera have amazing pictures and battery life is also good but only one problem back single camera after all money value product Before buying this product i was so scared that what if the product is fake or may be used. We bought the phone during sale period near Diwali. Its nice phone with big screen. Ideal for people who reply to emails or do a lot of work related chat on the phone. Batter life seems to be really impressive. It goes without charging for 1.5 days with constant internet connection. The phone had a software problem, the microphone was not working. WoW experience This is clear update for me after iPhone 7. Camera quality is awesome. But the most impressive thing is battery life , it was seamless. You could miss 3D Touch but itís ok . do not buy it as does not come with dual sim slot , for this esim required and in INDIA only jio and airtel provide e sim technology Value for money as good quality and money wise but price daily coming down in the market as Amazon price and market price is down do not have to say much,  apple is apple and makes best phones,  once you buy apple you do not want to try any other phone,  it is amazing phone Heating so fast in use after 15 minute of use Very very bad product accessories very cheap quality packing .....Also facing problem regarding warranty ........Just after 6 days of purchase ...Charger adapter and lighting cable ha failed ...And ...Apple care is also behaving badly ... Highly disappointed regarding .....Please give me a way to return my phone..... Really user friendly, user interface is buttery smooth..camera quality awesome( esp. portrait mode).. not sure how it compares to iPhone 11, Iím happy with this phone got a discount on hdfc card. bought it to gift some one else. As per the users response, its a good phone, works effectively Doesnot look like an original iPhone, keeps hanging its not even a week old. Does Not take finger commands well n hangs continuously. Pathetic product. I need a replacement I am loving it...!!!! Upgraded from android Fingerprint reader is not there only face lock which is more than perfect Amazing battery life. Even on heavy use, the battery lasts the whole day easily. Iphone XR is super smooth, face unlock is fast and really impressed with the privacy option related to apps. Best iPhone to use for its 55K price This is my first iPhone XR.... After using the phone I realise why the iPhone is special....the features, screen touch, the look, are all awesome.... Happy To Be Purchase iPhone.... I purchased iphone for brand n its dual sim and i found it more value for money. The phone gets hanged during every incoming call .i practically have to cut it and call them back . NOT very please with Apple ,expected a better working phone for the price they charge. Bought it during the second great indian sale for 41k. Though 3k higher than the 1st sale I am very happy to buy it as I know itís a good deal. I am very much statisfied with the phone quality and delivery speed. But the packing quality should improve. In fact, the features and functions of this mobile are very good, especially the price is very low, which is 39 thousand only, and the mobile was delivered in a very short time, it is now priced at 45 thousand, An excellent phone. Does what you need at super speeds. Face ID is a charm. I think I got an excellent deal in the Dussehra sale. Only thing which has dumbfounded me is the colour. Looks orange on screen and more pinkish in real life. Solved using a Spigen black cover.  Should have gone for black. Received mobile through amazon while buying new set it self speaker ?? problem still not received any feedback from amazon they  just sold the mobile not taking responsibility feel very bad. There is poor customer support since the amount of I phone XR ?? Rs. 45k very huge. Have been using this fone since almost 1month, its simply adorable and a beauty (red colour)..camera quality is awesome, battery could have been improved a bit(16-18 hrs on full net usage).. In camera video and slow mo is not working properly and I havenít received any bill neither hard copy nor soft Feels good if you are using for the first time. Great feeling to hold iPhone :) Iphone xr came just today and it is having white line defect on my phone and amazon is not replacing my mobile i am feeling cheated i have spent all my hard earned money on iphone ?? I am very frequent user of Internet data, but IPhone XR battery is awesome. It long-standing two days. And camera qualities is also awesome. Itís value to money. Not completely satisfied with the product as the dual sim on iphone is way too complicated. Battery and camera features is the best of XR. I am facing difficulty in disconnecting / hang up the call, when I remove the phone from my ears, the lights didnít appear so that I can disconnect the call I need to wait for other person to disconnect the call from their end because there is no light on the screen. Most of the time the red button didnít work at all. Excellent mobile...bought it for 38000-2000(cashback)=36000rsesim jio prepaid working well..battery life excellent (1complete day for me) Been using it from the past couple of months the phone has been great itís my 1st iPhone as Iíve always been an android fan in the past , great battery life and very smooth . Can say itís totally worth the price . The product was just as good as an apple always is and the delivery was prompt. I am an apple user and I require all my gadgets to be in sync which is why I bought this. But always look according to ur requirement and then buy the phone that suits you best! Best iPhone you can buy at this price range. A pretty huge battery life, smooth interface and an outstanding camera. The phone is good donít had any issues,but in box contents they wrote EarPods and gave normal earphones which is wrong information...they wil not give anything even sim card placement pin also As the mobile is cool and fast performance and the interface is amazing as it is apple it feel the same all things are went good but only one bad thing its display as it is 720p display but slightly colour variable can be noticed but tho its good mobile at good price in apple A big change for me was moving up from iPhone 7 Plus to this phone is the Face ID. It is super fast and very accurate. If you are buying just because of the brand name then go for it, else it is of no use. Upgrading from iPhone 6 (16GB) to iPhone XR (128) was the best decision I ever made. Everything is so perfect & optimize. Touch, display, camera, sound, processor, battery.. literally everything.  Apple needs to work on their latest iOS 13 though. (Also Iím getting more kills on PUGB:) Hands down to A12 Bionic. Excellent iPhone in that too 40k. Camera battery and touch is Incomparable . 128GB variant ,Used it for a month,Great performance. Excellent finishing and stylish. Face ID is powerful as it works even in pitch dark conditions. Camera is amazing . A bit bulky when you put a cover as the rear camera is significantly above the back surface of the phone. I got a different item This rating is only for the product not for  Delivery.  Till the last minute I was kept on my toes. The box was not completely in a sealed condition. Can Amazon answer for this? Coming to  Handset, No issues at all. It is simply amazing. One should know how to use it wisely. I would update my reviews after using it for few months. when i got this phone after unboxing i din\\'t get the proper accessories in the box headphone is missing Screen becomes unresponsive very often and there is no way to restart the phone because the screen is unresponsive Best phone from Apple after iPhone 7. Nice phone Product is good. Face ID works fast. Battery lasts longer than previous iPhones, depending on usage it can last up to a day. For heavy usage and gaming the battery lasts up to 6hours. Camera is good in daylight use. Low light photography is grainy. Overall a good product. Finger print sensor is missing , the phone is bit heavy Good Priduct Face Recognition, Battery life & user interface is secondary. Itís an iPhone thatís it. Apple satisfies our high expectations. The Apple iPhone XR was Awesome. Really Worth it. I got it at 31900 /- with exchange my old android phone .i never believed in this low price I can get dual sim iPhone with latest chipset.thanks to amazon to providing great discounts I am a 6s+ user now upgrade to xR a good phone with nice camera, while being water resistant, provides a good battery even for backup for gaming. automatically restart some times Phone is super fast you will never shift to android after using iphones. Only problem that few apps are not well designed for apple like voot they keep lagging rest everything no need to explain I got this for 38 k. Good deal. Awesome to use. Unbelievable product..Crafted to precision...Mobile at its best...Amazon deal is mind blowing..best place to get an IPhone...Delivery is fast...Camera is excellent...IOS rocks...No second thoughts...IPhone is the beast to own..Amazon is the place to go.... Beautiful product, Got it @ ?38k during billion day sale. Battery, camera, face ID and everything works well. Slightly heavy and bigger, if you are not used to use large screen phones, but use will soon get used to it Needless to rate Apple any less. An year old Appleís A12 bionic still outperforms SD 855. And iOS, such a beautiful liquid smooth OS that Android can never compete. I have purchases this iPhone XR on New Year 2020 eve....and i can say that this is just awesome phone with great display and more important very gd battery performance....i just love this iPhone and want to recommend all those who are just thinking to buy new phone then this is for you..... Itís been 2 months I have purchased the XR, everything seems to be fine I.e, bigger in size, good battery life and advanced processor. †I love iPhone 1. When i started new product it asked for setup of apple id and in the process, product was heating 20+ degree and suddenly restarted half the way. Camera picture is yellowish. First thing that strikes you is the colour. Vibrant and really nice I have bought iphone xr through amazon sound quality is wrost speaker is pathetic when i approached them to return they clearlly denied....very bad exeperience. Defiantly iPhones are costlier than other brands, nowadays other brands like one plus are also selling phones at 50 k but the quality between iPhone and others are at no comparison Camera is awesome ... both for selfie as well other photography .. and fast interface .. only minus point is battery life time ..But yeah rest all features are good which makes this phone special !! Loved using it. PRODUCT RECEIVED IN GOOD CONDITION BUT FACE RECOGNITION FEATURE AND BACK CAMERA IS NOT WORKING WELL.THE I PHONE SUBMITTED TO I PHONE SERVICE CENTER LAST WEEK FOR REPAIR. Got it in 38k at the sale. The best iPhone till date. Itís a fantastic iphone. Perfect size, display is good, battery life is incredible. Camera results are excellent and comparable to xs and xs max. Super fast bionic A12 on board handles everything superbly. Ohh...what can I say about this phone... just one word- AWESOME. I think itís better than iPhone 11 in almost every aspect. The portrait mode is outstanding. If anyone is using iPhone 6,7 or 8, then this is next iPhone for you... face recognition is very fast iOS to Android (one plus and must admit, the phone is amazing and Iím still amazing), but back to iOS and do not regret. There are soo many little things that does make the difference and leaves the user with WOW feeling! XR is a bit thick but with time we get used to it. There was a hardware failure just in less than one month of purchase.  Amazon takes no responsibility of replacing it and I am working with iCare to fix it. It may even cost me to get it fixed. I was extremely unhappy with this phone and the post sale service. Just unboxed and found defect in screen. On informing Amazon, I was first assured for replacement and then amazon changed stand and asked me to contact apple care for examining mobile and creating inspection sheet even though problem is clearly visible and accepted by amazon as well. the phone is bogus nd it gets heated ,sometimes charger does nt work.camera is average,plz do not buy from amazon Worth of upgrading- One of the best camera in this price range, mind-blowing photo and video quality plus not to mention the best ever battery life on any Apple device I have used so far. Disappointed that it does not come with finger print scanner just face unlock. Otherwise it is a good apple phone if you r tight on budget Battery life is good Bought two phones on this sale. One is this awesome iPhone XR and another Samsung phone. iPhone is so awesome that I am in love with its touch, display , camera and sound quality and everything. Its very costly but I love this. Whilst others phone that I purchased was a big mistake. Was a little doubtful while purchasing since i was not sure to receive a genuine Apple iPhone but received absolutely a genuine one. Working perfectly till date. The only thing I donít like about this iPhone is that it takes a lot of time for charging. But its okay, itís manageable. Itís Apple and behaves like one! Itís slightly on a heavier side and a bit too big considering itís 6.1 inches. I have moved from 5S to XR -and it is a mind blowing experience. Battery life is okay camera is awesome everything After Apple reduced its price, iPhone XR did become affordable when considering its features. What I received was how it was described on Amazon. Reviewing after one month of use. Good battery life, amazing sound quality and camera is very good. Really love my first apple product. They have no fingerprints but face unlock is not compare to other its awesome battery is very very good and camera is best and iPhone is the iPhone not compare to other brand and most best thing is it is duel sim wow.......only not giving fast charging adaptor supported but you have to pay extra I was first hesitant about buying iphone xr after all the negative review....it has been 10 days and it is really a wonderful product.i got this deal for 38999 from amazon. Not charging fast as intended and battery discharges too quick. Needs replacement. Quick guide please. Phone stuck in between use of apps. Contact @8249530210/7873655744 The phone freezes frequently. Battery doesnít last long. On the whole I am very disappointed with the  phone. Did not expect this from Apple. Excellent Model with extraordinary deal during the festival season. I love Apple products and this is no difference. Quality of Photos is awesome. Battery life is better but i still feel can be improved. However for my usage it is ok. I shifted from android to this iphone , it really worth with all new amazing and premium experience . The battery life is far better than my expectations from iphones . I got this phone for 43k and I feel itís absolute value for money. Excellent sound quality...& thatís no one device is beat in this quality,Immersive display & awesome  performance .. I find display issue with my iPhone after a month now. I see thin black line from top to bottom just an inch from left side. Battery adapter is also not working properly. I am also unable to access amazon customer care also Great battery lifeís buttery smooth transitions/animations so so refined compared to an Android phone .Face recognition is a bit glitchy though my daughter can trigger it for my wifeís login I do not know how to explain it, but no need for any review... Just one word.. Apple... Go for it... Its worth your money.. The product is a masterpiece but the box corner was damaged like the box was undergone ruff conditions This is my second purchase of I phone through amazon I am happy and satisfied with the product....thanks to amazon ...keep it up The most unique feature of this product - face id for unlock is not working in the product delivered to me. Now i have to keep visiting the apple service centre to get it fixed. I have got the delivery of iphone xr yesterday and I have found that there is a spot near the front camera. Can anyone or the apple customer service tell me why it is like that? Iím an Apple fan, because of its simplicity, elegance & good camera. In addition, this phone has a longer battery life, even with good internet use. May be the price could be little more competitive, but all in all, a nice phone. Excellence phone. Every thing this fine. iPhone XR camera is better than OnePlus 7T...XR beat OP 7T... Excellent Phone... I like the phone very much. A great product from Apple.  Very happy that i bought this product in a discount. Worth every penny. The  photo quality is amazing.  The re-charging time is so less. Marvelous phone came with the proper packagee and proper secure coding from Amazon. Thank you Amazon for such an organised delivery I received the product with hair line scratch on the screen which does not appear at a glance but upon reflection of light on a specific angle it appears.  During delivery I could not detect it but after few days I recognized. From Apple I do not expect any cheating on product quality iPhone is always master in mobiles. Itís really amazing. Thanks amazon for best discounted price Day one is good with XR. Will have to use for some more days before conclusions. Battery life is impressive. Feels good to handle. Seems to slip out of hard sometimes. Face ID is not good..works sometime..sometime forces to use passcode to unlock..default keyboard layout does not have dot key..while editing text it is hard to place the cursor at a desired place in between a word..hey Apple get some update about these in if next update.. Amazing product as can be expected from Apple. Super camera. Super battery life. Super display. Amazing iphone XR experience ..you do not need iphone X or iphone Xs or iphone11pro the perfect iphone for any one who loves Apple brand ...go for iphone Xr or iphone11 both are just fabulous Amazing piece of art and technology from apple. Buy this beast especially if you r getting it below 40K. As far as the delivery experience is concerned it was not good and smooth at all due to delays and poor packaging from Amazon. Thumbs up for XR only not Amazon delivery experience. Amazing phone, the xs and xs max are way better but the price of this phone is the real winner. I got the fast charger and some new BT earphones woth the difference. Overall being my 1st iphone, it is really amazing My 4th I phone Just received the product! Feeling excited! Detailed review will be coming after a month. Delivery was awesome placed the order by yesterday evening received at today noon! The package was damage free . Letís see the future performance The overall look and usage is good but the time it takes to charge is nearly 3 hrs from nill to full.Considering to backside design its little coddy when compared to x .Definitely but you feel very much premium when using this the white is astonishing like sny thing worth for money. Looks good and also working great. The disappointed thing is while I was purchasing there is a screen replacement warranty but now it is not there. My first iphone..there are some problems switching the os but Iím so far happy with this change.though battery life is just okay with a mediocre and cheap charger. This a big daddy for all other branded phones ...I upgraded from 6s to this model..really a good decision i think .but one thing itís looks very big in hand ..you have to spent some time with that. Best iphone in this price range 1 month review. : Best deal from amazon under 55k for 128 GB , Excellent battery life almost used upto 2.5 Days with 4G Data enabled ,No face lock issues , Camera Quality is good but portrait feature works only with human face detection ,Red colour is very attractive its for my wife . shez coming from iphone 6s to this one . so its a upgrade for her . all in all a great phone . The phone I received is not starting at all and I canít see the option to replace, this is cheaty Nice phone in a great price deal... Best budget iphone currently. Got it for 40k(128 gb model) in amazon sale. Great phone from the greatest minds This is a very good product.You should buy it without any hesitation.Go for it.Battery of this Iphone XR is very good.It lasts upto 12-13 hours with light use.Face recognition is also excellent.This phone is very smooth to use and you will definitely love using it. good because phone is just awesome. Battery backup n camera is also good. But the phone is not slim like 6S or X/XS. A very good phone. Camera & facial recognition is just next level. Njoying it throughout! Best ever apple phone for value for money. Nothing to say. Amazing discount by amazon and delivery is also before time. Satisfied. Proximity sensor not working. Not able to make calls as all apps keep openig wbile making a call Like: Display, Sound, Battery Yesterday i got these Xr after a week at 52k best offer the best thing about Xr is battery life is good compare to other iPhones Xr is powerhouse games like pubg we can play in HD smoothly no heat no lag good camera not best iím satisfied no issues genuine product from amazon What a great phone!! Battery life is amazing, navigation is as usual the iPhone mark... overall an excellent experience. Apple is one of the addictions which never go once you use I use 7 and now xr to my sister absolutely beautifully crafted device and excellent camera phone.?? Loving this phone. Everything about this phone like speed, performance, camera, its amazing. Best for rs. 46200 Very good performance. And very good cameras .. water resistant and wireless charging makes this phone complete The quality of apple is fab you canít match with any Android smartphone...tried several smartphone but nun has given me this kind of superb experience.. The only 1 issue I actually faced is the mic is in very wrong place if i am driving it is very critical to answer inside the helmet as the mic is in back side of the phone. Rest all the awesome Itís been two weeks using the phone and I donít regret buying this... too good camera quality and battery back up... good enough storage... loved it!!! Everything is good so far! pH is dead, not responding. Defective product. And no option to return. Excellent phone with an excellent camera & fantastic battery life; dual sim (second one is e-sim) option is quite practical. Camera quality is excellent with portrait mode. iOS is as usual superb & user friendly with excellent performance. We do not see much update on this version however we see that phone is as always amazing with the performance. Everything is excellent ... if you want to buy then surely go for it.. (in short paisa vasul kaam) First time apple user... but to be honest... apple is amazing from the all aspects.. camera, sound , battery , display , lagging issues everything is far better than android mobile....itís 12 mp camera looks like 48 mp of an android mbl...! Quality differs from others !!!! Iphone is the best. Prompt delivery from Amazon. Two camera could have been even better Good product, great experience! When I switched on it started getting heated up near camera.  Mix of gold and yellow is bit ugly. My other side of speaker isnít working. Selfie portrait is good rest is not much appreciable. Superb it is. It does not require any review. Large screen, superb quality, 128 GB memory and what else you want iPhone XR is the current rightly priced phone from Apple. It is a good product . This phone does not have fingerprint unlock security, only face recognition is present. Perfect phone for Apple lovers, camera and built quality of this phone is amazing. Itís around 6 months when I purchased this phone, everything works like a charm, there are lot of hidden features that I still donít know about this phone. Reason for 4 star as the earphone given as part of this purchase are not up to the mark and when I take call using earphone people complaint about sound is not proper and sound come good when I remove the earphone while talking on phone. I had bad experience from Amazon within 2 days my phone having charging issue and I did not get any response from Amazon. I have upgraded from iPhone 7. Face recognition excellent, Camera Good with portrait photography. Battery life... Very good. Bit heavier, but comfortable! Amazon did the delivery a little bit late. But the phone is awsome. Very nice phone, very fluid interface, face recognition is really very good but I think Apple should bring back the fingerprint scanner and that Apple specific home button. I got this during festival sale at Rs 45000 and I am really enjoying this phone. Performance, camera, sound, display everything is top standard and no smartphone can match this at this price. Love this ???? Phone is not working properly and they are not replacing my product and the product was in replacement warranty.  Please do not buy from Amazon because if there will be any problem under 10 days they will not replace the phone. They will just give the customer care no. Lot of software issues in it. Specially your contact names will not displayed on screen when you receive the call from one of your stored contact person. Raised the issue multiple times but very poor performance from Apple. Do not buy this model. People spoke have criticised about the iPhone XR\\'s screen, compared to xs I found this screen is more colour accurate, My new XR PHONE  is GETTING HUNG frequently When I shuffle around the apps. I donít have much apps active though I moved apps from my iCloud. Even few apps get struck and couldnot do any actions. I havenít seen in my 6S though the issue. Using it since 15 days and till now could not find anything disappointing with this phone. Battery running for about 2 days!, Camera is single lens but clicks very good, Speed and screen all is perfect. Upgraded myself from Iphone 6s. Awesome experience with IPhone XR red Color There are some problems with the iPhone xr I bought 15 days ago. Most affordable iphone really proves when it comes to photography, performance and off-course Battery backup. Having been with it for almost 2 months it has clicked most of the boxes urban smartphone should offer. Only complaint that face reader is not as great as fingerprint reader in older version of iphone. iPhone XR simple superb. Awesome phone, good battery life, awesome camera... 4k recording and i have started vlogging channel in YouTube with xr only,,, shooting, editing and uploading all in one.. awesome performance. What I really admire about this piece is 2 things: The product I received is value for money. Battery life is pretty much cool. Loved the system performance. Worth buying. I ordered the phone on August 8 2019 and it was delivered to me on August 14 2019 and itís been 7 months and now my phone is fully dead and is not working at all. I have only used the phone for couple of days now, but it looks really good. Amazon did a good job in timely delivery. Probably the phone is very good so far, and I am in no position to give a proper feedback unless have used it for a while. Best if you donít want to see annoying ads in ur feed Great product, a good upgrade from iPhone 6s, large screen, fast, water resistant, great camera, and looks good too Original Product ??, still remember while opening the packet please make a short video of what you received. Superb phone. Wish they could match the battery life with what other manufacturers are offering at one third the price Apple may release the dual sim slots for India. It may increase the sale and customer also i think. Defective piece This is awesome product as usual. Didnít regret but buy this. Must go for it. Only thing, this is a bit bigger phone for single hand user. Great phone with good fingerprint reader, camera quality and long lasting battery life ! As always grt Nice product, looks good Awesome mobile.. Very bad experience with the iPhone XR Battery life is good but the problem is with the phone heating very quickly. Even redmi\\'s who are known for getting heated quickly, get less heated as compared to iPhone Xr. I steal one star for it. iPhone XR is really one of the best Apple Products Iíve ever used! Iíve had used iPhones in the past but nothing matches XRís feel and optimisation. Not only does it look good, but also performs superbly well. Much recommended. The features of the phone are very good. Camera and the operating system. Anyone here to compare this with android. Please keep in my, comparison happens between apple to apple and not apple with oranges. 1. I have purchased iPhone XR 64 GB .All are features seems good as per expectation but I got newt work issue in this phone . Hanging issue, network dropping issue needed restart to get network again. Face detection is also very disappointed, please never waste your money with this product. Nice phone in all respect. Just go for it, try buying the 128GB or 256GB model if you are planning to record your game clips ... because 30mins of screen recording costs 4GB memory .... Best phone for the best price. Purchased at prime sale for 40k. Best iPhone ever for this budget. Worth the money, performance is good even with 3gb memory.  Apps are pretty fast. Itís a good phone obviously, It doesnít have any defects, delivery was smooth and non-problematic, phone works great, best camera ever, overall, Iím happy with my purchase The Iphone has been stuck on set up page after i tried restoring it. I heard many people fear to use Apple phones as its os is slightly difficult to use. But I feel that once we are familiar with it then it is very easy to use compared with android phones. The build quality is superb. Also the camera is fantastic. Good phone. I been an iphone user for the design simplicity. This is a good phone. One does not need a pro version. This is a champ Have bought this iPhone after iPhones 6.i am pretty happy with the device,battery is too good,camera is great,Performance is swift no lags till now played hefty games like pubg  and asphalt 8 on this phone no lags were found at all.overall an excellent device I bought this phone last week and in one week charger started misbehaving. Sometimes charger got disconnected and sometimes phone is not getting charged . I purchased it from Appario pvt ltd. And they sent me a genuine, brand new iPhone XR so 5 stars. Best budget phone by apple,cannot believe the overall performance and the tremendous display quality, who says the display is not good, obviously its not good itís excellent. And thanks to Amazon for providing me the phone within 12hrs. I already have Google Pixel 2XL.

Battery easily last for a day. Amazing Camera. Got it for 40k and at this price there cannot be any better device. I upgraded from iPhone 5s to iPhone XR and Iím not regretting at all. Battery capacity, camera, speed, everything seems perfect for me. Your budget is not enough to buy iPhone 11, max or max pro then definitely you can go for this. You will not regret it. Really great product by apple just love the beast inside this machine... charging is quite good. And mostly pubg is super smooth and everything is great really a beast by apple One month of usage and the phone is dead ! Tried all solutions suggested by apple but no signs of recovery. Next option is to take it to service center. iPhone XR one of the best mobile and os Finger print reading and camera quality is good. Apple is the best. iPhone XR 64gb is best buy even in 2019. I bought it during festive sale at 37,999/- †I am happy to buy this amazing phone from Amazonís thanks .... itís original phone ....love this camera .each and every thing in box charger headphones manuals books...seal box Recived. Best in the Class... Awesome battery life, magnificent design, camera quality 10/10, fully satisfied, worth of every penny. Buy it with blind eyes.

I am very happy with it Speaker not working one side when I get calls sound very lowwww Value for money phone . bought at 39999. perfect . absolutely perfect . Good one, very nice product, no complaints till date camera is good, super battery life loved the product, red colour is awesome It is a genuine product, verified on apple\\'s website. Everything is working as expected Everything was just perfect. Within a week the ringer volume varies and the  WiFi signal is very weak when compared to other iphones. Camara quality is good , Face ID works well. Everything good you expect of an iPhone Super phone ... great product and thanks to amazon for the great price Man the battery life increment from iPhone 7 was mind blowing.. screen is not a problem unless you have used a 1080p oled screen. Perfect phone at perfect price. Most liked Apple phone with dual sim. Amazon price of this phone is lowest. 43000 Rs. Best phone with best display battery camera is excellent everything is best Total fraud gone with me , initially face sacnner was good but now a days after one month itís not working properly n problem of going phone hang is obvious n regular, total disappointed from this phone n if this happens further i m going to sue them @AmazonIndia It has almost been three months since I bought this phone and am now facing a problem with its left audio speaker which has completely stopped working. Only the right audio speaker is functioning.  Kindly assist. A hair line crack which could only be detected by the shop keeper who was applying the screen guard . A very fine crack which was missed Product arrived good,got it at Rs 38000 at amazon sale.Thanks Amazon Good phone.  Not aware it has finger print reader Apple iPhone xR, I think this product donít need any recommendations, only my review for amazon sale. I bought this at never before price 37999/- Only cons are overall little bezel around the screen as compare to XS version. Battery lasts for a day on normal use including music, chatting and social media use. Good delivery from amazon This is an awesome product by Apple. Awesome product, Worth buying if in budget One of the best iphone I have ever used.  battery life very good.Camera quality has no match when it comes to shooting videos from XR. Amazon service is good. Best phone so far. Battery backup is unexpectedly huge Speaker of this phone is cracked while I received this product Nice camera and superb battery life compared to previous models of iPhone. Very happy with my iPhone XR red. Awesome phone and apple tag it self looks so premium in hands and face lock works superb overall happy to buy this phone instead of one plus 7 Got the phone for Rs 53,250 in the prime day sale. Used it for 5 days and itís the usual apple experience. Good picture, touch and camera quality is excellent considering it has a single camera. Itís a bargain at this price bracket. So let us face the truth, everyone thought that its a flop iphone from apple. But it turn out to be great. The LCD screen everyone was talking about is not that bad, you wonít even find any difference. It is little on heavy and bulky side coming out of apple but given the price range itís a good buy As apple kept the price it is worth it for a first time Apple user but for old apple users the xr is not that great Apple it has thick bezzel and its quite heavy too what its good at it is the colour options and camera quality and the chip it provides. Charging pin problem Very happy with performance especially sound and picture quality †bad product Camera unable to use any external links in this article but it should be mentioned in this discussion on the web very disappointing. I received an old phone. It already had pictures clicked. I love it Battery issue is problem discharge very fast and take time to charge almost 03 hrs. Dude,, this phone is a beast..you will love this phone My first iPhone. Awesome phone. Rich User experience, speed, battery, camera, looks excellent. Smooth, fast (no lags). Good build quality, best lcd display ( not to compare with sAmoled screen) 5out of 5. Must buy. Amazons quality product. This phone is kind of the best iPhone in terms of value of money. The only thing you will miss is the oled display which is on the expensive iPhones but only when you compare them side by side. Got the 128gb @50k so pretty good. It is awesome iPhone. Loaded with a pack of features. Face ID and Memoji is super, Thanks Amazon and Also to Apple. Facetime did not work.Air Drop fails too. camera quality is as like my earlier IPHONE 6. Battery performance is excellent. I have moved from iPhone 6 to XR Quiet good but little bit of scratches only on outer cover. An improved product by Apple, appreciative. Powerful battery and camera is supremely good, suggest you to have another wireless charger, rather than fabulous product. loved it. i live with it. very durable battery. good picture quality. Best Budget iphone. Got The right buy at the right price. The battery is holds up well. Rest is as described by lot of reviewers, it is an easy to use and maintain iPhone. Apt pricing. Good for designers & developers who need a test device. Fasted delivery Camera is good , First of all apple product is genuine product no lacking , but however battery charging is too low compared with new edition with android phone vocc charge and dash charge at least apple should have fast charging Technelogies Video not working. Out voice we cannot hear. Amazon is giving worst products to customers. I am going to file a case with the proofs It has been a week since I started using it and as of now thoroughly enjoying it. awsm camera n good performance This is my first iPhone. Great experience. Bought @43k price in sale in 22 January 2020. Great design ??. From photos I thought that there will be airpods with it but actually it is earphone ??. But phone is awesome.Best phone for 2020. YOU said it is a water resistant product but when I was answering my calls the front speaker was not working properly and I could not hear the speaker. This was my main issue and other was that constantly my phone was lagging in between. Everthing about this phone is good except the back glass which is not durable.the backglass shattered into  pieces from simple fall in the car and apple asking to phone for whopping 53000 to change thephone my phone is just 20 days old A beast , thank you Amazon for quick delivery,  definitely a worth it phone apple has manufactured  . Always a Apple lover .. Very happy with my decision! This phone is amazing and the blue colour is very cute and unique being an iPhone. The battery life is better then the other iPhones that I have used and you will fall in love with the camera!! Moved fro iPhone 5s and xr is simply superb. Good mobile , but bezels screwed me , battery life is decent , please skip this and buy iPhone X , a waaaay better than any other devices , it is nice , compact , premium feel, Xr doesnít gave me such a good feel iPhone does not need any reviews.its always best and better that iPhone X If you have a budget of 45k you should definitely go for iPhone Xr it has super powerful chipset and no matter what you do you cannot use it to it is full potential it is buttery smooth and super reliable with great battery life Mobile of d year... truly fast... great camera.... good price 38k thanks to amazon... Touch Screen response slow.dificult to close running apps. Sound not working, buy from another seller Itís a higher end mobile so the screen guard should be provided with this packing it can work to make customer Happy. There was a line in the display. Does not support dual physical sim . Screen size is smaller. Does not allow google . All downloads are paid downloads.  All songs storage is through I tunes application which also comes at a cost. Lot of drawbacks for a normal user and not user friendly. Leaving all other iPhone advantages over android i mention the pros and cons of this device. Phone hanging issue observed. Application closing swipe up action hangs the screen and does not allow to close the application. After restart phone works well. This is intermittent. A good phone especially for camera quality. And lives upto all I phone users expectations. Although not very user friendly for non iOS or android users. The colours it comes in are genuinely awesome. Earlier i was having Apple Product which i bought it from Dubai, and now i am using XR which i bought it online, and this really sucks. The earphone quality is not the one apple used to have, Zero Noise Cancellation, zero Quality. Mobile has some defect. Gets struck some time. Awestrucked with this I phone.. one of the best i phone i have used.. i have 4S, 6S and 7. I experienced trouble while using the phone for calls. I could not hear most of the time or the receiver could not hear. call fails in between abruptly.  This is very annoying phone. I wish I had returned it. Itís an awesome phone with some great inbuilt features...donít worry about the display it wonít disappoint you at all Do not think much if ur dual sim lover than go with iPhone xr †This mobile is gud but fast charging is not available it will take 5 to 6 hours to charge fully I have a doubt it is an old one Amazing received original I phone XR , rear camera performance is God leval when front camera quality is not good Good looking phone at g8 price 37999 it fulfills more than my expectations an ofcourse the brand is enough to justify the value of product Good one every thing is superb I love this phon very much and now m going to buy laptop also please do quite low price macbook because I have to buy please do some less price macbook because I have to buy after luckdoun please please You will never get service for this brand. iPhone service center not taking there product. Good battery.packing is very poor.iphone cover is good.so my phone is not damaged. I have been using this phone for the last 4 months and itís working fine, And the best part about this phone is its battery. Now the price of this phone has decreased alot one can definitely buy this phone Nothing great about the phone, would prefer oneplus 7 pro version. Every feature is quite impressive but the camera quality should be slight higher its not up to the mark as shown in advertisement.. My phone stop working after 3 days...I hv to rush to apple store ...thank god I got my ph replace..I really got worried as it was new phone ..but will not purchase phone again online will purchase directly from store.. As usual, Apple product when compared to other mobile phones in similar category are priced higher .. but I like the improvements in battery when compared with previous iPhones Good product. Loved by my husband as a birthday gift . I did not get a warranty paper in any form along with this product. The product seems to be in perfect condition though. Its very bulky and photo quality is not good. Great look coral colour One of the best purchase from Amazon. Packing and Delivery is good uncomparable. The phone and it is performance are satisfying. 12 days usage of the phone left me without a complaint. I give 5 ?? to this purchase. Iím mad about I phone forever and ever no words to define This iphone is my second iphone followed by iphone 5s and battery of this phone great which provide at leat 1.5 days backup. iPhone xr is great phone Just go for it. Everything was known. If your budget permit go for it. All apple product..only budget is issue. Display quality is fantastic, face recognition has some lag issues Awesome phone got it at a Very good price during the Prime Sales The weight of phone is too heavy... Although the video recording is awesome the Photos quality simply does not justify it is price... Just the best smartphone in this segment. Absolutely love it. The quality, the software, the camera, the face id, the battery and everything. FaceID & handsfree is not up-to the mark. Battery is draining like anything please help. Is it a genuine product. Amazon please help as i heard the batter suppoy is good but in this product batter is worst. it is iPhone !!! What else???? Ringer voice is very slow what is the issue I donít think any phone comparable in this range. The phone is amazing but i got cheated as i was promised the EMI of 4040 per month for 12 months. The sum of rs 4275 got deducted from my account. This is seriously not fare as i m paying almost 1500 rs more for my phone. Awesome phone. Very good battery backup. Fingerprint scanner not available. Lightening fast Face ID. Call quality is awesome. While transferring data from android to iOS, WhatsApp chat data wonít be transferred. Got it at 43k during sale, and you can get it for 45k during normal days. This price cut is because it is being assembled in India. It is a great value for your money at that price. †Best iPhone xr but it is a bit weight and good performance but heating.. bought it for 38k I upgraded from iphone 5 to Xr, and there is a huge difference in battery. According to my mobile usage, I used to charge iPhone 5 thrice a day and Now, I charge my Xr once in 3 days. The difference is immense. Got at ?36,999.00/- on 28.09.2019 The phone is good, the only problem that I am facing is that the phone keeps freezing for few minutes since the new iPhones have launched. Service is very good by Amazon. 5 star Good quality as the name says ìAppleî. But price dropped down after my purchase. I wish to buy IPhone 11 good phone This seller is not reliable, the brand new sealed phone did not work and had to be in the service center for a week. Do not recommend Appiaparo. Also, this was not the first time that there product was faulty Every 1 knows wats the quality of Apple is, no reviews are required. Best of Apple make till know. I really like the phone its awesome i upgraded my 6s to Xr i am really happy with the performance Whenever we try to call any person, the opposite person cannot hear anything. We went to apptronic service centre , which was of no use. We have paid rs.42000/- for Iphone XR but not able to use it. We need replacement The product is amazing with its features. The battery performance is  remarkable.The response for the Face ID is also Awesome.The only Con is that itís Slightly heavy.the overall price has also gone down considerably. Battery life has a problem, also gets hang sometimes. Product was good, but got a defect in camera lens. Even though i got camera replaced from a planet care store, but still i never expected this from an apple product. This was my first apple product & probably my last. Appearance  is Very Good Amazing phone which has almost all the features of iphone Xs. Amazing camera and battery life Awesome product...nothing can beat iPhone...excellent Nd full security... Great product. Battery easily lasts more than a day and very good camera. Iphone XR is one of the best phone. Camera Quality is awesome . Got this Phone  at approx 40K. Itís worst mobile, this is not value of money, iOS is not friendly user,worst battery life, oneplus is better than iPhone Display quality is not as per standered  as apple , when i use this fone  , i could have feel stress in my eyes  . Using this for more than 2 months. The phone is awesome. Camera quality is really good. This phone is the strongest iPhone. It has the best battery. It lasts for one day in normal usage. An amazing phone by apple for an affordable price I am not satisfied. Screen touch for select any app is very poor & Iphone xr stopped working automaticallyq without any reason and is not working fine.My suggestion is not to buy from here This is the most worth iPhone now ! It finest have 3D Touch but it is amazing ! And camera is just wow and always the same iOS smoothness Superb performance A great leap for me from 5s to XR. I am enjoying this smashing experience. Loving each and every bit of this marvel. Speaker stopped working within 4 days of use !!! Everything is good but the battery dies too fast. Maybe they meant to say lowest battery life in their ad but mistakenly wrote highest. Anyway the software is no doubt amazing. First time coming to iOS from Android, always used to hear why people praise so much to the iOS. It definitely meet the expectations, so far so good. Smooth UI, Nice Camera and crazy battery performance. Thanks Amazon. :) Apple announced one year free subscription of Apple TV plus when an apple product is purchased. How can I get this ? Camera is really pathetic. Just usual mobiles costing less than 10000 are far better in taking pictures. Phone is amazing,  amazon delivery is not notch,  received it next day.  Overall amazing phone It is iPhone... I feel better than 11 I feel. The phone is good so far.... initially had trouble with the ear piece while calling, it is working fine now after removal of its plastic cover... phone is classy. Features are great, feels premium in hand .. Nothing can be luxurious than this at the time when you hold the piece you will feel like out of the crowd and join elite legacy speaker is not working properly, and getting extra noise while listening to the voice from other side. †Such a worst product , do not buy , all time hang, I am despointed to iPhone xr Love the phone. I wasnít sure about the size of the phone. But once I started using it I think the size is perfect. It was a bit heavier than expected but the built is amazing. Overall is a terrific buy. Wonderful, Classic One ! I used to be fan of I phone 3Gs mobile, I am getting same Feelings with this mobile, camera quality much much better compare to any otgers, YOU want to buy it, just grab it, Good but I think iphone se camera is far better.overall good device.battery backup is awesome Itís a Face ID in this phone and not fingerprint, best deal and there is no need to add dedicated review as itís a apple phone :) as usual never disappointed with apple phone Perfect product in the price range of 40k. It includes good camera, wonderful operating system, nice touch screen and product design. Only problem you may face is with battery backup. Got it for best price! iPhone is love. <3 <3 The charger provided with this product Stops working suddenly and itís only been 4 days that I received the product kindly get a replacement for the charger Really awesome device. Have been using for about 2-3 months... secure, fast, and really user engaging. Yes, price is always a issue with apple devices but their devices make every penny worth it... at least this one does?? Best buy This phone iPhone XR is the best value for money itís as hard as a metallic brick Feels solid elegant in your hand especially the red product I am totally happy with the device and would recommend it thanks Apple I was very happy with this phone. This battery had very long durability.Value for price. The quality of picture is very good it had 4K video up to 60fps . It is very good phone for those people who want an iPhone It is one of the affordable iPhones. Speed and quality is same as XS, a little difference with regards to 3D Touch and camera. Face id unlock is awesome, battery backup is best of all iphones. Touch is butter smooth. YOU have to go by IOS user interface not like android UI this is the only con. Best cam Obviously itís an awesome product I had this phone XR on deal 128gb n m happy now to have this AMAZON giving original Apple products that is what we want Got it during Festival sale with good discount from amazon India . Best iphone till date on every specs  with butter smooth ios and camera quality also looks good.

It is the value for money iPhone. I have been using it for the past 3 days and I am really happy with its performance. Phone looks great, easy setup for existing Apple  users, camera is impressive with the additional modes. Overall totally satisfied with the purchase detailed review on battery after one month of use will follow. This is the best phone anyone can buy given the price range. Had a little trepidation before buying it from Amazon given the comments of Amazon not being an authorised seller, but this product is worth a go! Great phone Best Buy so far.. was sceptical about ordering online, fearing a faulty piece, but worth every penny. Good phone. Definitely worth the money. For me it was either one plus 7t or Iphone XR. Being an Iphone user for such a long time, i juat couldnít go for one plus. Turns out to be the better decision. Mobile is superfast same as amazons delivery speed. Camera is good, face unlock is fast and gets my face everytime Excellent phone, superb camera ,screen is extra large , processor is lightning fast What a powerful device delivery at time good packing. I am 15 year samsung user but apple is apple Very good phone i was android user but first tym using ios and only want to say go for it donít hesitate to shift from android to ios you will not be disappointed very good phone in apple series iPhone XR is a great phone on budget price, great camera but only lag is the battery life, that apple should work on.

Please resolve This is my 2nd Iphone (Previos one is Iphone 6) but this one is undoubtedly Perfect in all aspects whether it is face recognition or camera quality or batter life everything. Thatís what I call a Smart Phone. Face recognition is too good, front and rear camera quality is very cool, especially in night and yes battery life of iPhone XR is way too better than other iPhone series almost 7 to 8 straight hrs can be use Really like for display, battery life and operating comfortably. Got it in 50k during sale. Overall an Excellent phone.?? Awesome mobile brilliant quality performance good .thkq Amazon such beautiful mobile xr just go for it colour wise in India white,product red,,black and also yellow also awsome but Iam taken white colour . Phone gets hotter while charging and while watching video. Has it been repaired and sold? I got XR with a great deal in Amazon and surprising this is awesome variant from Apple. Face ID works awesome and battery life is too good Camera is awesome. A single 12 M.P rear camera beats other 60 M.P Androidís camera. It was very good, Face ID is much improved after updating to IOS13 version. Iím using this from 2-3 months now, with one sim itís giving good battery backup but if you are using esim(dual sim) do not compare with android dual sim phone battery backup. Camera is good. Feels little bulky. The headphones stopped working after a month or so. There is no wear and tear. Touch screen is not Upto the mark. Amazon did not provided the original bill of Apple Xr to me in soft copy at my email nor hard cooy to my house. Please provide the same at the earliest.

Great phone for the price. Performs really well compared to the higher end phones at the same segment .

Very good battery life and very nice photo quality. Dual SIM works smoothly. Excellent call quality and speaker sound is loud enough. Overall a very decent phone. No finger print .very pathetic. wen you use helmet you have to put password and password also not work fast type. Battery drain fast and charge late. Camera also not soooo gud All is good however, this was purchased on EMI , but amazon did not initiated process with bank on time and EMI could not be activated, called amazon customer care nothing happened, bad on amazon part Product is reliable and good There is no fingerprint reader in XR.

Received genuine product with one year free screen replacement. Loved it. itís been a week since i got this and itís been amazing I must say best iPhone device of apple. Colour (Red) is looking very premium. Camera quality is excellent even in low light condition. Longest battery backup from iPhone devices. Excellent product. If you are a fan of quality and durability, this is it. Amazing battery life and innovative integration with Mac and Watch. Awesome Iphone XR loved it My Order date was 19-May-2019, So i thin 1 Year Warranty is expiring in May-2020. I need to purchase extended warranty. Kindly assist. Battery is aswesome, and screen visibility/touch screen is too good. Replaced my iphone 6s and i am quite happy with this phone where i can use my entire day in 2 hrs charge only in early morning. Got a defect mobile and got it replaced. They simply publish that the product is replaceable within 10days but when we they tel us to get replacement key from apple. Such a faking morons It is such an premium phone. The build quality is great and UI is fast and fluid. If you want to have a iPhone with all latest features by sacrificing the display this is the one for you Good product camera quality superb, battery life good and face lock. I am happy to receive the item and thanks to amazon for deliver genuine product in very short time I had an issue with waterproofing of the phone as proper functioning of the ear speaker returned 2 days later after the incident. The best iPhone in affordable price with huge screen.......loved it to the core ???????????????????????????????? Battery life is amazing... this phone has changed my mind and thoughts towards iPhones. I have used every iPhone as of now however battery life is amazingly good in XR also camera is outstanding. I already knew the product was good, you donít invest without actually studying what youíre buying, the service by Amazon was great, I got next day deliver, best offer and a good quality product! I as using Xr since last two week, totally satisfied with the phone. Thank you Amazon for the original product, quick delivery and awesome deal. The entry level product to get into Apple house of quality product. excellent phone delivered by amazon in very good condition. Only hitch is apple should provide fast charging options (when even low range phones are supporting fast charging). I phone xr is also a good product, battery life is better than other i phones in market. Value for money. Face recognition is superb.. battery life is better than average.. camera is good..product is good happy to use What can I say, itís an apple. Every inch of it is pure bliss particularly the camera , superb battery life I delayed my decision which cost me 5000 because of price hike but still 7000 less than market price Loved everything about this product. brought it on sale at 35k and can not point out a single thing which is not as per expectation. Great battery life, lasts 2+ days with heavy usage. Voice quality even on Vodafone network was quite good, and that is saying a lot. I was not given ear pods even though it was mentioned in the description of the product, kindly send me the ear pods Budget iPhone with some miner issue, proximity sensor not works properly, if call is on and we move away phone from ear then it shows black screen, or not lightning up screen Received product well nd got good discount. Actually iam an android user for past 6 years but now i want to upgrade to i phone nd i choose xr so i decided to buy it in amazon really i feel so gud nd they are rally kind nd gentle to me tq These people promised me for cashback n now they took their step back ... they even have recordings of their promise ....worst site even phone also defective .... not working well after a month No flexibility in personalization of handset.. Not user friendly.. Their is a difference between sophisticated & complicated.. It tends to inclined towards latter.. They have not provided lightning connector but mentioned in the box providing lightning connector Do you really need any review here? Probably not. Camera,battery,face recognition are excellent Reasonable price in apple range n worth it Did not expect such poor camera quality from apple phones even my earlier iphone had a better camera. Overall has a good battery backup but really disappointed with camera quality... We can not add song and videos from the outer device.

The phone is a real bomb. Just loving it. Best camera, long battery, everything is great. I would highly recommend this phone. I am in love with how this phone feels in the hand when held properly. Battery life is super good. Bad battery life and heats up Overall worth paying, value for money, durable, efficient, advance product Value for money no difference 11 or sr Packet received from amazon without any flaws.

All day battery in heavy use and two day with normal use... camera is super awesome. Thanks Amazon. Touching screen is not quite good, sometime it hangs, when calling time screen get blank, then we have to press Power button 2 times then it wakes up... Fantastic product Good and value for money This phone is a beast, great battery life and the user experience on this phone is amazing as well Colour is totally different. Do not go with the looks in Amazon website. Good perfomance. Got it at 42k Bad battery life Nice phone Nothing new to share about Apple. Itís a perfect mobile Finally an IPhone with excellent battery backup. Face recognition works perfectly and so does Siri. If you are unsure about Iphone 11, go for this one It is a nice deal through Amazon.The product quality of iPhone XR is amazing.Such a grt experience to have an iPhone.This is first time I m using an apple product.You can go for it blindly Good product but single back camera Never purchase Apple products on Amazon. Worst product! Even worst service by Amazon! The phone was having heating issues! Very worst quality 100% satisfied with the quality  shipping genuine product all things are working fine product is 100% genuine shipping time as said very fast Nothing new to write about iPhone. The color of the phone is just gorgeous!!! Everyone loves it. Capable of good processing and memory optimization is fantastic which leads to lag free experience in high gaming application It is a great phone for professional usage Over all the performance is good. I am happy with this iPhone XR especially for all day lasting battery. Excellent mobile phone ,I love it Moved from android to iOS different experience. Good battery back up. Getting charge is too late compared to android mobiles. Fast charger is not available with box. Camera was awesome Just owsm.. battery backup supb, camera quality supb, class look Exactly after 15 days my lightning cable discharges some greenish liquid and stopped working , and when shown to apple service care center they told it willbe not covered under warranty. This liquid retina high quality display does not beat my Samsung A8. Very disappointed. Sold in 2day. The name itself says a lot about the product I switched from Android to this one and it is worth the switch. I got it for 50k which is the lowest deal ever. Overall build quality is good Great purchase from Amazon and product even better as expected, you canít compare with other brands apple is apple... its good product but not tested for esim I like this phone, great battery back up..and after all its iphone. Happy with it Face recognition Nd battery life is not too good as I was thinking..the face unlock is automatically open by my bro face as he is not put his face as password in the phone then also how When the call come together it hang and light of to use again we put side up down button 2 times Better than iPhone X, but price is still high compare to OnePlus market Awesome price and awesome product by Apple and sold by amazon. Best product this time.  Do not go for x or 11. Go for it then wait 02 yrs.for new one. Very good phone..takes very long time to charge almost 1.30 hr I got a iPhone day was only working for 3 hours post which it never got started..lot of effort done but not single customer service could let me know what is the way out. Screw you guys Every thing according to my desire. Battery is comparatively good according to my desire. Camera quality so majestic and with high quality and resolution. Eternally better than android Nice camera Amazing battery approx 24 hour e sim dual sim functionality very good I love it superfast delivery by Amazon thank you Amazon and Apple After iphone 6s i purchase XR model..which is highly smooth in usage.. I do not seem to have got cash back of RS. 3000. Can you please check. overall satisfied with the new iPhone XR NYC The product is good for those who are in view of buying ios having a full display as per the recent trend. Sometimes itís automatically switched off while it have enough battery life. Ringtone sound and other output sounds are not rangable one and its like low level mobile. Its best budget iphone to buy in market right now. Display is not a serious issue and remaining features are similar to its siblings xs and xs max. Bought it for ?52k so got a excellent deal. over all mobile is good but after one month using this phone now my battery Maximum Capacity showing 98% which is not acceptable. if you want to secure phone then go for ios. Product is damn good on all counts. A fast charger required. WhatsApp data transfer  from earlier Android device is not possible. All the features were cool except the green dot that appears on most of the photos in the form of a lens flare is a bit annoying. Buy it without hesitation,awesome camera, awesome battery life , everything is good. Nothing to say about it I am very disappointed with Amazon within 3 months of buying an iphone the phone got dead and is not switching on. I would not recommend anyone to buy an iphone from amazon. After long time apple have launched budget phone which is very good. Itís awesome. Itís my first Iphone and I love it so much. Battery life is too good. Genuine product received not fault in package no product damage. Wonderful device. Go for it, value for money. Bought during Sales. Ppl who wants to enjoy great experience of iOS at budget, then go for this. I am sure you will not regret. Great buy, i was using android for years never used iPhone. But after purchasing Xr i can clearly see the difference, iPhone is far more faster and nice interface Super smooth and easy to use with full 1.5 day battery life with dual SIM and moderate usage of phone... Superb phone at 45k ... Apple at its best ... Awesome processing ... I purchased this iPhone XR I think the same is refurbished item which I received. Excellent Product Excellent phone with wireless charging. Best mobile in low price, camera quality is batter then from China mobile 48 mega pixel means 12=48 ??

Excellent performance and swift touch Except it gets a little heated in the back while playing , other than that itís the best. The mobile phone is too heavy and there is no fingerprint sensor (though there is Face ID). Otherwise everything else is great. Thanks Amazon for this superb deal,its highly unbelievable to get such an excellent model of IPhone on such a reasonable price. iPhone XR is a expensive branded phone and itís a water and dust resistant but After only three weeks use  i found dust in my cameraís lens .

There was a manufacturing defect. Chek ed with other devices in showroom and all were normal white. Returned the device and claimed refund for this. There is no finger print sensor. But face id does a pretty good job. Love this phone. Camera is good but not the best. Bettery life is the best. Face recognition is fast and reliable even in dark condition. The screen is best in LCD class displays. Nice product Altogether I liked. But an easy way to type other languages than English is essential Bad front camera and weight of the phone. Display quality of the screen and rear camera are amazing No regrets after using almost for 1 month. Dual sim working perfectly. Guys go for it if your budget is approx 50k....donít spend on other android phone... Mobileís screen is not scratch resistive. Awesome product!! Sometimes face recognition stops working.
